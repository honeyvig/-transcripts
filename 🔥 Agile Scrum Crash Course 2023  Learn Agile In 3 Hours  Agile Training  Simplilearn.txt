scrum is a widely used project
management framework that promotes
collaboration flexibility and iterative
development it breaks work into small
manageable task called Sprints and
employs a self-organizing team approach
key features include daily standup
meetings product backlogs delivering
incremental value to customers scrum
helps teams adapt to changing
requirements and deliver high quality
products more efficiently so are you
interested in becoming an agile scrum
professional here we have certified
scrum Master CSM certification training
course some key features of this course
include two days online virtual classes
two-year membership with scrum Alliance
20 pdus and 16 scus includes CSM exam
fees as well by the end of this course
you will be skilled with scrum and agile
methodologies importance of agile scrum
life cycle scrum terminologies daily
scrum and review roles involved in scrum
and distributed scrum one year of
experience is preferred to enroll in
this program so hurry up and enroll Now
find the course Link in the description
box so without any further delay let's
begin by understanding what is aile
methodology over to our tutors look at a
time in the late '90s what was happening
with software development forms so they
used to follow waterfall
methodologies so there used to be
expression like sir you have a problem
so what happened so our client want a
new feature to the software we are
already Midway creating the software we
can't add the feature so what does it
mean so there is a scenario where the
change is asked so why change change may
be because of adding certain features
removing certain features modifying
certain things already given what is
wrong in that why can't we do the change
so now Point here is not about doing the
change itself it's about the effort
additionally takes cost money in terms
of which is going out the effort then uh
the scope which is going to change at
the same time you also need to put more
efforts which will delay the project so
now is it okay so '90s it was okay today
is it okay a big question mark so why is
that not okay so we to understand that
very clearly right I knew we should not
have used the waterfall methodology for
development so is that an issue with the
waterfall methodology so answer is no if
it is today scenario answer would be yes
if it is '90s answer would be no so what
changed in this 20 years or 15 years the
Dynamics of the market changed the
behavior of consumers changed so if you
look at anyone who is using any product
it may be a software product or a
hardware uh like if you mobile phone or
a television or any application mobile
application or application used on your
systems the upgradation of the new
features and functionality of that is
improved more and more and consumer
wants it more and you have a very less
time to respond that is one thing second
thing there is lot of competition if you
do not respond quickly competition will
take over so for you to sustain and grow
it is very essential that you understand
this Dynamics and you need to respond
quickly which was bit difficult when it
comes to approach what is called
waterfall model now how do we address
this so what is that waterfall model is
all about why is it difficult for us
so the methodology where waterfall model
is used involves teams following a
series of steps and only going forward
after the previous steps are completed
so there is a wait time involved so
until the previous steps are completed
only then I can move to the next so it
is a slower thing it would take certain
longer duration so it is best used in
the scenarios where the teams are small
and the project is expected to move in a
predictable manner so predictability is
very important when we follow waterfall
methodology predictability the variation
should be as lesser as possible so what
is that predictability I'm speaking
about as I create this product as a
results comes up if it takes 6 months 1
year 2 years 3 years it's okay so this
is how the product would look like the
predictability how the product would
look like how that particular output
would come so when is that going to come
is it okay if I bring that result after
2 years is that okay so if everything is
okay that with without very less without
any variations as such very less
variations then it's fine so because of
folling waterfall model U what is that
methodology what is that flow we need to
understand that so requirements
Gathering and documentation is the first
thing what used to happen which is true
in AEL methodologies also but the main
difference here is the requirements
Gathering and documentation happens in
detail a comprehensive one now once that
is signed off only then it is moved to
the design now based on that requirement
which is gathered which is full
comprehensive then the design will
happen based on that the consideration
of process the products the people the
environment then the design happens
which is again a detailed design now
once the implementation starts if you
find any deviations the correction needs
to be done since the design is in detail
the deviation possibilities as less as
possible but the challenge comes up when
the the Dynamics in the market when the
Dynamics of customer changes customer
asks for change then you may require to
do the change now when you want to do
that change you may require to do that
change only after understanding what
would be the impact of this change in
the entire output which you're going to
create which is very comprehensive one
so because of this it consumes time it
consumes extra effort so it may be a
scenario where the scope of work is
reduced as well even after that this
exercise has to be done which will delay
the project so this was okay so when
this model when things were done things
were taken up for changes it was okay
because the consumer Behavior as I
mentioned there's a lot of wait time for
the consumers also so there was less
competition but today it is not I need
to go quicker so because of this what
are the disadvantages which has came up
to the consumers or to the organization
who actually follow waterfall
methodologies in today's scenario so
what could be those so making changes
would be difficult as I mentioned
earlier so then it doesn't focus on
inducer client customer perspective
value so today I think more and more
we're speaking about creating a value in
the consumer perspective customer
perspective and the time it takes for
Consumer to realize the value how long
it takes the more it delays in realizing
the values by the consumer there is a
delay in terms of making your product
impression better in the consumer's mind
so competition will take over so your
existence will be in bigger threat
so testing phase is delayed until most
of the project is completed because it
has to follow step by step wait the
things to complete and then testing
happen then measuring the progress
within the stages is difficult so why is
it difficult measuring the progress
within the stages because the
deliverables or the metrics what are
defined are defined to measure at a
milestone and at a end of the phase to
understand whether everything is
delivered as part of it now let us look
at how agile is going to help help us to
address these disadvantages mentioned in
what fall model so what is agile the
basic meaning of agile is to move faster
be flexible respond to change Etc but to
accomplish this there are a lot of
methodologies now there is something
called agile Manifesto on 12 principles
of agile which we need to understand so
following this accomplishing this can
only help us in becoming agile so in
2001 agile was introduced so that's
where the term agile came into picture
where people start realizing what is
agile and why should we adopt that agile
methodologies so while it was introduced
so agile Manifesto was also released
it's a set of principles used in project
management and software development so
basically there are four points which we
need to understand very correctly very
clearly so that we can able to
understand what is agile is all about
right it enables team to deliver value
to their customers with ease so agile
team deliver work in small but usable
increments then evaluation of the
requirements plans and results takes
place continuously this allows teams to
respond to changes quickly now change
was one of the scenario what we were
speaking about now responding to change
quickly is one of the disadvantages what
we spoke about and here it is addressed
it is considered to address that is very
important now when we respond to change
quickly it is not that I just quickly
responded but I did not address that
problem or that scenario it is very
essential to address that scenario as
well effectively and efficiently so now
agile is a concept right so it has a
detailed Manifesto based on which all
the agile methodologies are created so
what is this agile Manifesto is all
about so it is created it was created
during February 2001 so which details
out the values and principles of agile
processes which says there are some
values which is mentioned in the left
which has more weightage compared to the
one which is in the right now when we
say this for for example let us take let
us go one by one individuals and
interactions over process and tools so
are we saying we don't value the
processing tools that is not the case
now let us look at what were the typical
issues or challenges anyone would have
expressed regarding the processes so
delay maybe bureaucracy and they cannot
have a flexibility to move faster so
basically delays because of the approval
which is not happening because of the
processes now how do we address this so
can I eliminate the process itself
answer is no because in the absence of
tools and processes none of the things
which we can do easily can exist so it
should be there process and tool should
be there the way it should be defined it
should also ensure there is individuals
and interactions encourage to have that
individuals and interactions while
having the processing tools so next is
working products or comprehensive
documentation so when we say
comprehensive documentation as as I
mentioned in the waterfall methodology
during the requirement Gathering during
designing there is a detailed
documentation which is made so which
take lot of efforts in creating those
now while delivering the challenge what
anyone was faced was the change which is
coming up and making changes to these
documentations which is an additional
effort now if we have a working products
if I have a bigger product in that a
module of that I keep creating every
small small modules of it and start
integrating to the base model now I will
only focus on the documentation for that
particular model working piece which I'm
going to create in the next iterations
then my documentation changes are less
and also the way I'm making the
documentation is initially I would have
a full skeleton of the entire product
which I'm going to create the road map
and upon that I'm going to making the
detail documentation for that only for
that working piece rather than the full
product itself then these working piece
documentation which I'm going to create
as I create the working pieces I'm also
getting the feedback because I'm doing
the interactions with the users the
consumers the end users so I get the
feedback I keep making the changes
quickly and then documentation will
become accordingly the small pieces of
documentation which happens with those
small small small working modules which
are created and those are Consolidated
over a period of time by the time the
product ends you have a comprehensive
documentation the project ends you have
a comprehensive documentation so it uh
saves lot of time so documentation is
important but the way we accomplish the
documentation is one by one not in one
go next is customer collaboration or
contract negotiation so any engagement
or any relationship or any business can
it happen in the absence of contract
answer is no there should be a contract
now how this contract should be when we
want to follow in agile it should allow
the customer collaboration why are we
collaborating to understand what
customer is required to understand what
customer needs is fulfilled right so now
this requires a lot of flexibility in
the contract itself so that commercial
is one area which gets impacted and
there should be guidelines for that also
in the contract so that during the
collaboration during the change during
the effort being put customer is also
informed what is the change which is
going to happen in terms of commercials
as well as time and everything so that
it is documented in the contract so
there is no confusion responding to
change or following a plan now I cannot
have a rigid plan as we were speaking
about waterfall methodology so I we need
to go like this only
So based on the scenarios changes so we
be requir to change your directions and
move faster so responding to change
requires a specific flexibility which is
required in the plan so that I don't
have a plan which is very rigid and that
provides some flexibility that's how I
can able to create my plan so that I can
able to move or respond to that specific
scenarios which are changing so this is
called agile Manifesto and this agile
Manifesto has 12 principles associated
with with this now keeping this agile
Manifesto on 12 principles all the agile
methodologies have created their own
approaches and framework now let us look
at what are those 12 principles the
agile principles so agile principles so
here are some of principles that need to
be followed to make a processes agile so
first principle is about customer
satisfaction so one need to satisfy the
customer through early and quick
delivery of the product now someone who
is hungry if you give them a water
or a food immediately a piece of bread
at least there is some satisfaction
there is some realization yes I got it
what I need so energy is back so it is
very much required to ensure seeing
things in a customer perspective and
customer is satisfied so customer
satisfaction is not a result of the
survey what I do it's about how I deal
with the consumer what is that impact
the perceptions I'm building with the
consumer and what do I know about my
customer do I really understand the
pulse of my customer
how Associated am I how close am I how
am I collaborating with the customer
that will help you to understand how
satisfied your customer is it is very
essential to consider customer
satisfaction and the second principle
would be welcome change so changing
needs need to be addressed even late in
the development process so change can
happen anytime now these changes should
not become a challenge so there should
be a flexibility in your design itself
which will bring in so that is the I
think when you move faster so it doesn't
mean that you eliminate or you just keep
introducing the defects and move faster
no that is not allowed so whenever there
is a change in the feature Whenever
there is a change to some specific
product functionality accommodating that
should become easier whatever the
methodology I follow that should help me
in terms of accommodating so I should be
welcoming changes it's okay for me to
have the change so that is not a
challenge anymore for me so principle
three deliver frequently so Ure software
is delivered frequently focusing on
shorter time scales as I was mentioning
while discussing the manifesto point
like I keep creating a smaller piece of
product modules so that I keep putting
into the base model and integrating
those and ultimately once all the
features functionalities are integrated
we have a product with all the features
and functionality so this needs to
happen more frequently so the release of
those working P should happen more
frequently more repeatedly so that that
customer is seeing those working piece
and experiencing and giving their
feedbacks so quick changes to those
working piece making that will become
easier then work together so when I say
work together it is very essential that
developers and business individuals need
to work together through the course of
project which means involvement of
customers involvement of suppliers
involvement of your own team everyone
should work together each one should
understand each other's perspective view
if there is no proper understanding ing
about each other's perspective view it
is quite obvious what was expected what
was delivered would not match so there
should be correct understanding to have
that correct understanding one should
work together collaborate so they should
speak Express it is very important so
feedback has to be given by consumers
regularly similarly organization who is
doing the project should also keep
giving the feedbacks to the suppliers to
make necessary changes and once it works
together in a Unison I think that would
help in terms of bringing out the
results the way it is required that
would help customer to get the value
motivated team so projects need to built
around motivated individuals and they
must be trusted to get the job done
means when will the team get motivated
when the work what they are doing is
acknowledged when the work what they are
doing the results are seen experienced
and then feedback is given there is an
opportunity for Learning and
contribution their contribution is
acknowledged only then team is motivated
when there is a motivated team when team
feels there is someone with whom they
can look up to is quite obvious team
will also come up with certain set of
innovation in their mind giving their
feedback as well involving themsel in
terms of getting the results what is
required so it is always essential to
ensure the team which is involved in
creating the products is always
motivated so I think when we say team
the conflict also come across there may
be a clash between various different
thoughts and differences so one cannot
just shy away being a manager one cannot
shy away from it he or she should
involve sit with the team resolve those
put things in the right direction so
right interpersonal skills are very
important here next face tof face
interactions so which helps in terms of
most efficient means of communication
which helps in terms of giving a proper
Clarity in terms of what is required so
that I sent an email I expect the person
to do it that is not the case what we're
discussing about so more and more
interactions which should happen face to
face so that each other understand what
requires to be done and there is a quick
feedback which can happen when that
particular interactions conversation
which keeps happening so one can
understand other perspective view as
well then working software so it is a
primarily the deliverable which you're
speaking about which has to come
regularly so more and more working piece
as it comes customer can give feedback
based on their experience on this
working piece instead of just imagining
something and then giving the feedback
so it should not look like an hypothesis
or or something which is in the
Dreamland so I told something the person
who heard visualize something else it
should not end up that way instead of
that give the working piece expect the
consumer the user to give the feedback
so that it helps in terms of creating
that particular product ultimately which
is usable and which is going to create
value to the consumers so next is
constant pace so agile process promotes
sustainable development so it should not
I did it and I sleep I did it and then
I'm waiting for something else no there
should be frequent deliverables which is
happening so there should be constant
moment from left to right from beginning
to end so that the deliverables which
are expected keeps happening so that
consumers or users are realizing the
value of it so it should be constant
Pace the velocity the speed which needs
to be adopted then good design agility
can be improved by focusing on technical
excellence and good design so when we
say technical excellence and good design
it is very essential to understand
inside towards what is the product being
delivered inside towards what is the
technology being used inside towards the
processes the capability skills so all
this comes together when people sit
together and focus on creating that
product or services so they are putting
the effort towards designing it
appropriately so that that will fit for
purpose so since things are moved step
by step in terms of creating a working
piece the detailed designing of that
small working piece would happen which
can can happen quicker as well and since
these are going and fitting into the
architecture which is basically open
architecture kind of scenarios what we
speaking about so all those modules what
you create you keep plugging into it so
that you are designing that small piece
was quicker so instead of Designing the
entire system as a whole in detail
you're just creating that small small
pieces and fitting into that
architecture which is open so pluggable
so that gives flexibility as well and
changes to the design will become easier
if it's not working and the agility
helps in accomplishing that Simplicity
the amount of work that's not being done
needs to be minimized meaning when we
say Simplicity doesn't mean less right
so the appropriate number of tasks the
minimum number of tasks which needs to
be done and mostly I think all nonv
value adding activities and processes
would be removed it has to be removed so
the more optimized more simpler in terms
of handling things is always good so
that only those what is required to be
done are done so it is very clearly
visible and there will be CL ity
self-organization so when we say
self-organized teams who is not capable
of everything but when you look at a
team as a whole each one has different
different skills many skills not one or
two skills many skills which they are
complimenting to each other so they come
together they discuss together they
focus on the architectures requirements
and design and address it together so
team is also owning the ownership is one
thing when it comes to picture when we
say team so here since team is actually
taking up that ownership and organizing
themsel to accomplish the results the
products what is required so then
obviously the results will happen the
way it is needed and they will become
accountable as a team so they cannot
have a blaming scenario where because of
one or two members it is happening they
should collaborate better they should be
self organizing what should happen so
next is reflect and adjust so when are
we going to reflect reflect upon what is
that happening learn understand keep
learning it having a reflection to that
what is happening means responding to
that so that that Improvement can happen
quicker Effectiveness can be improved by
the team regularly reflecting on it so
team is also understanding team is also
having that accountability to ensure
that necessary adjustments necessary
actions are taken to make those changes
and Corrections quickly so these are
about 12 principles so which supports
which helps that accomplishment of
Manifesto points the four Manifesto
points what is mentioned so keeping
these four Manifesto points four values
which is mentioned in Manifesto and then
12 principles so keeping these in mind
any agile methodologies have their own
approaches and they accomplish all of
this so further let us look at some of
the uh advantages what would be there
when following agile so we looked at a
disadvantages what we have when we
follow waterfall so did we overcome
those the disadvantages what we had in
waterfall did we overcome that using
agile so what are the advantages of
agile so agile is helpful in terms of of
handling large amounts of interactions
between client and project team because
it is throwing lights on it the
importance of interactions the import of
collaboration the what is that
self-organized teams it is spoken more
and more then improve transparency to
claims in every phase of the project how
this transparency because customer is
seeing those products the products with
features and functionalities are seen
they're experiencing it and based on
that they're given the feedback there is
nothing something hidden like when I go
with what waterfall till the end of the
project customer don't know what is
going to come out as a whole but here
since the working piece is given
regularly customer is seeing it the
users are using it and giving their
feedback so interactions increased so
visibility towards what we are creating
results is more right then the delivery
of the output is predictable and can
sometime be earlier than expected
because we know what is being delivered
more and more clarity users are
obtaining at the same time the team
which is creating is obtaining because
of it the pulse of the customer the
directions are clear accommodating
changes which was the challenges in it
was a big challenge in waterfall
methodology has become easier here so
then the cost of the project are
predictable and follow a rigid schedule
so it is very easy to handle the
schedules because more and more you
interact and more iterations are in
creation of small small working piece of
a product working module of the product
so now as you progress in that you
understood the environment better you
understood the clients better the
customers better the expectation better
and moving faster so that will become
easier for you now you have become
predictable You can predict easily what
is that going to happen ultimately so
more and more visibility you start
getting so handling things will become
easier so then it allows for changes to
refine and reprioritize the product
backlog so when I say product backlog we
need to understand the various different
user stories what is return to deliver
so that is a list of deliverables
product backlog what are there since we
already know what are the things needs
to be created so this helps in terms of
prioritizing those changing the
priorities based on the change scenario
and then taking the pace taking the
speed accordingly the client can provide
the priority of features allowing the
team to ensure maximum project value so
since it is visible what are the user
stories what are the epex return what is
that order priorities order of priority
what we kept now the change scenario
obviously tells us do we really need to
change this priority of which feature
has to be done first so that will become
easier because you have the list only
changing that order in the list and then
going forward accordingly integration is
not an issue because we have the base
model which can integrate all of this
together with no issues now then by
focusing on needs of the users the team
can deliver value to the customers so
users are involved more often so user
pulse is understood what user requires
is clearly understood so delivering that
value to the customer will become more
easier and simpler so then project is
broken into smaller units with high
quality development testing and
collaboration because you have the
flexibility so since you have better
visibility you can able to do this and
you move one by one iteration by
iterations you progress further so those
were the advantages of adopting aile now
keeping that agile Manifesto and 12
principles of Manifesto so what are the
types of typical aile methodologies
would come across so there are few which
we're going to look at as part of it
which we need to know so these agile
methodologies definitely considers the
agile Manifesto points and then they
demonstrate it in their own way now
agile methodology perspective let us go
one by one so some of them to look at
the first one is XP that is Extreme
programming so this is the framework
that enables teams to create high
quality software and improves their
quality of life so it enables software
development with appropriate engineering
practices so and then when is it
applicable so it is applicable to the
scenario where changing software
requirements to handle risks caused due
to new technology while working with a
small extended development team to use
technology to allow automated unit and
functional tests so that is about
extreme programming so next let us look
at kban so kban is a methodology which
is used to design manage and improve the
flow of system it is actually called as
pull system so visual system so
everything which is actually put on a
board and it is visible to everyone what
work need to be done what is in progress
who has to do it is very clearly visible
so organizations can visualize their
flow of work and the limiting their work
in progress so what is limiting what is
stopping is clearly visible so generally
if I look at whenever I'll just take a
scenario of
a meeting and minutes of meeting which
always discuss about it now when there
is a minutes of meeting shared with many
people who are participated in the
meeting there are certain action items
given to them for example now these
action items will have a Target day to
complete and accordingly those needs to
be closed now when the next meeting
happens when you look at that action
item status majority of them are not
addressed what could be the reason is
that people are not sensitive about
answering or addressing those so more
than that the prioritization changes so
one important thing we need to
understand how kban works here is it is
a visual system compared to that minutes
of meeting which is not visible to us
always the kban board is visible to us
always so one which is visible to us
always makes us put a conscious effort
to close it because our name is
indicated on the board the work need to
be completed is mentioned against our
name then we need to take it up and then
close it so it push pushes it it we will
put a conscious effort because it is
visible and I cannot build any stories
telling that why I did not do why did I
not consider this as a priority rather
than consider something else as a
priority so this Conan straight of
addresses it and then it's also called
as pool system because people pull the
work from it and then complete right so
where is this applicable it can be used
in situations where work arrives in an
unpredictable fashion so that means it
gives lot of flexibility in terms of
adopting to the changes which are
happening the Dynamics environment so it
is also used to deploy work immediately
without waiting for other work items so
since it is visible I think things can
go smoother easier so that people are
owning it rather than just disowning it
so now let us look at lean so when we
say lean it is very important for us to
understand that value is always in
customer perspective and elimination of
waste these are the two things mainly
spoken about so lean is a set of tools
and principles that aims to identify and
remove waste to increase the speed of
process development it focuses on
maximizing the value to the client
ensuring waste is minimized so when you
look at visualize of processes process
interfaces and the flow so the interface
certain way so unless the output of one
process or procedures getting into
another process so that flow should be
smoother like many pipes connected
together and water is Flowing so let us
assume series of pipes which is of
around 1 ft in terms of diameter of each
of the pipes water is flowing in between
if you have a pipe which is of half a
feet now what happens to the downstream
after that half fet pipe the entire
capacity in the downstream even though
it has 1 ft diameter pipe it leads to
the waste underutilized capacity because
this has become bottleneck now such
bottlenecks such the one which
contributes to the waste has to be
eliminated that is very important so
value should be seen in the consumer
perspective and that value would happen
only through the series value streams
then in this value stream the
identification of the constraints and
bottlenecks and elimination of waste now
what are the contributors of waste so
waiting time more often changing things
moving from one place to another place
allowing defects to flow which leads
towards rever work so all this likewise
many things which actually end up in
giving the wayte so one has to visualize
understand realize what are those non-v
valuing activities and eliminating those
is very important right so now when is
it applicable lean principles apply to
any sector where there is waste of any
form so it can be applied easily so one
needs to know that so that it should
effort which needs to be put with the
objective to accomplish so your ability
to move faster your ability to create
that product which is more efficient so
only you can achieve it the effective
results can happen only when there is a
lesser delays or lesser waste non
valuating activities that needs to be
understood and eliminate those so next
one of the popular methodology would be
scrum so scrum is a framework that is
used by teams to establish a hypothesis
trying it out reflect on the experience
and adjust it is used to able teams to
incorporate practices from other
Frameworks depending on the team's
requirement it's a simple framework
which speaks about a product owner a
scrum Master a self-organizing team so
some of the terminologies what it uses
is Sprint daily scrum product backlog
Sprint backlog so it's very essential to
understand this framework simpler and
able to adopt it is also very easy when
is it applicable it is used when cross
functional teams are working on product
development when work is split into more
than one 2 to 4 week iterations so these
iterations are called as Sprints Small
Time boxed iterations so this will also
help in terms of accomplishing the
results provides that flexibility and
able to move faster then Crystal so
Crystal is an approach to the software
uh development that focuses on people
and their interactions rather than tools
and processes it is aimed to streamline
processes and improve optimization it
works on principle that projects are
unique and dynamic each requiring its
specific methods so where is it
applicable it focuses on strengthening
teams communication it also focuses on
continuous integration active user
involvement and configurable processes
so these are the few agile methodologies
which are there which are more popular
more heard however we can come across
many other me methodologies like safe
Agile which is a scaled scenario for
more complex projects so likewise we
have many methodologies which
organizations adopt and these are few
for us to understand there are two main
approaches to project management the
traditional waterfall approach and the
agile approach originally agile
developed as a way to better manage
software development projects agile
emerged in the late 1990s specifically
in response to the Challen Alles
encountered when managing software
development projects using the
traditional waterfall approach
specifically addressing the burdens of
heavy documentation and frequent changes
in requirements agile techniques and
best practices began to emerge and gain
prominence in software development
projects this led to a meeting in
February 2001 in Park City Utah where 17
leading software developers wrote what
has become known as the agile
Manifesto let's review the agile
Manifesto for software development
together we are uncovering better ways
of developing software by doing it and
helping others do it through this work
we have come to Value individuals and
interactions over processes and tools
working software over comprehensive
documentation customer collaboration
over contract
negotiation responding to change over
following a plan that is while there is
value in the items on the right we value
the items on the left
more before you take your agile scrum
Foundation certification exam I
recommend you memorize these four lines
we call them the statement of value and
you can see that on the right hand side
those are items that are more relevant
for the traditional or waterfall
approach and on the left you have those
things that are more agile in nature
let's review each of these four
lines individuals and interactions over
processes and tools clearly any project
requires processes and tools however
individuals and their interactions
deliver better results when the emphasis
is not on the processes and the tools
working software over comprehensive
documentation documentation here refers
to things like status reports progress
reports detailed
specifications which do not really
demonstrate any real progress or value
therefore the emphasis is on working
software that can be delivered and
demonstrated customer collaboration over
contract
negotiation organizations need to be
flexible and accommodating rather than
following detailed definitions listed in
contracts responding in to change over
following the plan in agile small pieces
of working software are delivered to the
customer incrementally and the customer
is involved in the project from the
beginning to the end so in agile we are
responsive to the customer and willing
to make even midcourse Corrections in
order to deliver to the customer the
value that the customer
wants remember you will be tested on
these four lines so again I urge you to
memorize them in fact knowing these four
lines and having a feel for what they
mean will actually help you get to the
correct answer on many questions in the
exam here we can see what it might look
like to manage a project using the
waterfall approach you can see that the
system and software requirements would
need to be identified and documented
upfront that would be followed by the
necessary analysis and program design
work then comes the actual ual coding
and
testing that's Then followed by the
handoff to the customer or to
operations as you can see there is a
heavy upfront cost of
documentation as well as the status
reporting that would be to be done
during the course of the project you can
also see that it would be difficult to
respond to change in this kind of an
approach in fact the Standish group
issued a study that showed that software
development projects using the agile
approach succeed three times more often
than when using the waterfall approach
the Standish group defined project
success as being on time on budget and
delivering all of the plan
features the study summarized as follows
the agile process is the universal
remedy for software development project
failure software applications developed
through the agile process have three
times the success rate of the
traditional waterfall method and a much
lower percentage of time and cost
overruns now let's talk about strum
versus agile firstly let's have a look
at
methodologies now agile is a set of
principles that are iterative and
incremental agile has a number of
different methodologies you can choose
from there's XP Crystal can ban even
scrum for that matter let's talk about
scrum now scrum is an implementation of
the concepts of agile so basically most
of the important components of agile can
be applied to scrum as well it provides
the customer with incremental builds
that are delivered to the customer in
the span of 2 to 4 weeks an organization
can be agile but not practice Crum
however an organization cannot practice
crumb without being
agile next up let's have a look at
projects agile is more suited towards
projects that have a spa development
team that consists of experts whereas on
the side of scrum it's usually better
suited for projects that are subject to
a large amount of change and that do
rapidly next we have leadership now for
aile a project head takes care of all
the tasks and has a very important role
to play in the process of a j
a project head represents the entire
team and is responsible for getting
issues resolved by assigning them to the
appropriate members of the team in scrum
there's no leader there's a scrum master
who can overall guide the scrum process
but the team addresses issues by
themselves it usually involves cross
functional and self-organizing
teams next up we have flexibility agile
is relatively more rigid than scrum and
cannot handle changes with these it also
requires a lot of upfront development
process and changes within the
organization with scrum you can enable
teams
delivery agile requires frequent
deliveries so that they can get feedback
from the end user this in turn will help
make the product better the product is
delivered as well as updated on a
regular
basis with scrum after a print feedback
from the client for a build is provided
to the team scrum involves daily scrum
meetings to review and get feedback to
determine the next steps of the project
the next print is only planned by the
team after the current Sprint is
complete next we have
collaboration with agile collaboration
involves face to-face interactions with
team members of other cross functional
teams first scrum daily standup meetings
take place with specific roles like
scrum Master product owner and the scrum
team and finally we have design with ag
Gile the design as well as its execution
it's relatively
simple with scrum the design and its
execution can be Innovative and
experimental so you might be wondering
which one should you choose now among
both these options there one thing that
will remain common agile now what you
can decide upon is which agile
methodology you'll be choosing is it
lean is it Canan or is it scrum now if
you do want to know more about how scrum
and Canan are different from one another
you can check out our video scrum versus
Canan can ban comes from the Japanese
word can bam which literally means
signboard
like scrum can ban is a popular agile
framework that is a visual system by
which the work can be manage with ease
as it
progresses Canan uses something known as
the can ban board to make these things
possible with this you can easily
identify bottlenecks and then fix them
cost effectively at optimal
speeds the main focus with can ban is
transparency since everything related to
the the tasks are on the board everyone
can keep themselves updated it also
ensures the team's focus on their
current tasks until they're done this
limits the amount of work that's in
progress so on the can ban board work is
divided into smaller more manageable
pieces the work that's needed to be done
is written on a note or card and placed
on a board columns on the board help
represent where each item is with
respect to the workflow now let's have a
look at what these are in
detail let's find out how Canan
works now the board consists of three
major
components there's the to-do list which
represents items that need to be
completed the ongoing column which
represents items that are being
currently work worked on and the
completed or the done column now these
represent tasks or items that have
already been completed now although this
is a physical representation of the
board several organizations use software
versions of the board that replaces the
sticky notes with cards that can be
moved from one column to another as work
progresses now an example of such a
software is Trello so if you want to
learn more about Trello you can check
out the link link I'll be adding to the
live chat in a
moment at this point you guys must have
realized how similar these two
Frameworks sound so let's run through
some more of their
similarities let's find out how they are
similar firstly they both have
principles of lean and agile which means
reduction of waste and both of them are
time boxed and itative approaches that
enable product delivery in an
incremental
manner both these Frameworks aim to
reduce the amount of work in progress
this forces the teams to ensure that
they focus on a smaller set of tasks
this also makes blockers and bottlenecks
a little more
visible in both cases the work is
divided into smaller more manageable
units both of these Frameworks use pull
scheduling now this means the products
are only Built based on demand rather
than
forecasts transparency plays a major
role in both these Frameworks by helping
them Drive process
Improvement and in both cases the
release plan is continuously optimized
and finally both these methods aimed to
deliver releasable software often and
earlier than expected so so now that
we've reached Midway let me ask you guys
a
question do you guys use scrum or can
band in your workplace or do you use
these software for personal reasons what
exactly do you use these for let me know
in the live
chat now let's have a look at how these
two Frameworks are different from one
another firstly let's have a look at
Cadence Cadence refers to the amount of
time in a Sprint or before a release so
when it comes to scrum the entire
project is divided into time constrained
iterations that is into smaller
manageable
units but when it comes to Canan it's
even driven the next criteria we're
going to have a look at is release
methodology in scrum releases take place
after each Sprint which usually takes 2
to 4 weeks to complete for Canan
releases take place in the form of
continuous delivery they happen in such
a way that changes like new features
configuration changes bug fixes and
experiments get to the users in a safe
quick and sustainable
manner next up let's have a look at how
changes are addressed in both these
Frameworks in scrum no change can be
made while the Sprint is in
progress once it its complete changes
can be considered in the Sprint plan and
then added to the Sprint
backlog with Canan changes can be made
at any time and incorporated into the
workflow now let's consider the metric
that's being measured in scrum for
planning and process Improvement
velocity which is the measure of the
work that can be completed by a team in
a Sprint is the key
metric in Canan Le time is the key
metric this represents the period of
time between a new task's appearance in
your workflow and its final departure
from the
system next let's have a look at how
teams work in these Frameworks in scrum
you need a cross functional team to
achieve your goals in a Sprint in Canan
cross functional teams are optional but
specialized teams that focus on
particular aspects of the workflow are
are
required now let's talk about new
additions in scrum just like handling
changes you can't add any items between
a Sprint or an
iteration in can band new items can be
added to the board as long as there's
capacity available for
it now let's have a look at the job
roles Within These Frameworks scrum has
three major job roles product owner
scrum master and scrum team with can ban
you don't have any specific job
roles now let's talk about
representation or moreover let's talk
about how data can be
represented with scrum the Board needs
to be reset once a particular Sprint is
complete with Canan the board stays
persistent throughout the entirety of
the
project and finally let's let's have a
look at project link with scrum it's
better suited for longer
projects and with Canan projects that
can be completed in a shorter period of
time are
better so which one should you
choose now selecting from these two
methods is mainly based on the
requirements of the team do you expect
your project to be shorter do you want
to make changes at any time you don't
want to set up job specific roles then
can ban is the framework for you or do
you want a long running project with
different job roles and involving cross
functional teams scrum is the answer for
you based on the differences we
discussed in the last topic you can make
an informed
decision now let's have a look at some
of the popular companies around the
world that employ both these
Frameworks some of the companies that
have successfully implemented scrum our
Facebook General electronics and
Adobe companies that have implemented
Canan our seens BBC and sap so are you
interested in becoming an agile scrum
professional here we have certified
scrum Master CSM certification training
course so hurry up and enroll Now find
the course Link in the description box
what I want to do team is I want to
before we get into the user stories I
want to go to the white board and I want
to just give you a little bit more
information that might help us in
organizing our discussion that we're
about to embark on
here so a word that is not in our slides
is themes themes are
epics and user stories grouped together
you know similar epics and user stories
grouped together for planning purposes
so an epic is Big um you would never do
an epic in or pardon me a theme in a
Sprint it's too big um so it's used for
planning
purposes below that I would put epics
ethics are low
priority large user
stories meaning that an ethic will
eventually have to be disaggregated into
multiple user
Stories the reason it would be low
priority is because if it if an epic was
higher up on the product
backlog um it would have to be more
detailed that's when you would break it
down so epics are usually going to live
at the lower uh priority levels of a
product backlog and as user stories are
completed in the Epic rises in priority
it will eventually be broken down into
um more manage ible user stories so
great big low priority user stories then
we have user stories
themselves user
stories are
functions or
features that the product owner wants to
have developed a user story turns into
working
software that provides value to the
customer and um and the product owner is
the customer voice the product owner is
the one who would accept or reject
completed user
stories and then there are
tasks and a reminder when we were
talking about the Sprint planning
meeting we said the Sprint planning
meeting is uh got two parts to it the
first part is selecting all of the user
stories that are going to be included in
the Sprint and then disaggregating each
of those users stor into
tasks that's done in the Sprint planning
meeting and then those tasks are the
things that are actually then done when
the uh work of the Sprint
begins user stories can be estimated in
story
points or ideal days most teams favor
story points they might start with ideal
days but they will then usually end up
going to story points um Tas s are uh
estimated in
I ideal
time which is usually hours okay so now
back to our slides so at the top left a
use case could be an example of a user
story so it's something that um the user
wants to do and how the system should
support it um like um a use case could
be um select and pay for items in a
catalog now that could actually be an
epic or maybe a theme because maybe it
would get disaggregated into log on
screen uh catalog uh shopping cart and
checkout but so the use case could
either be a standalone user story or it
could actually be uh a number of user
stories um that would result from it
below that requirement it could be a
functional requirement a technical task
or even a bug fix so I'm going to go
back to the Whiteboard and a product
backlog is going to have a lot of user
stories that come from the
customer right whatever the customer
wants
then but the team may know that it has
to do some development work in order for
the user stories to even be able to work
you know there's some system level
non-functional requirements that need to
be done and so there could be Tech user
stories and then can you see this low I
can't see your chats but then there
could also be defect user stories there
could even be risk user stories now what
could happen is that um the product
owner ranks these in priority so this
one first then that one then that one
and the team says well the only thing is
is that um we have to do some
development work before we can actually
do user story to and so what we really
need to do is insert that before the uh
the second priority user story and so
the priority of the user stories in the
product backlog while it might start
with just being you know simple
functional user stories coming from the
uh product owner it will evolve until it
includes some other things that are also
considerations when it comes to uh
priorities because of you know successor
predecessor relationships dependencies
and things like that are um
considerations a user story be uh back
to the the uh screen um bottom left now
the user
story um can use a fictitious user or a
Persona to help uh the team or the the
team and the product owner to get an
idea of okay who's going to be doing
this function uh what are they going to
need in order to be able to complete the
function Etc so you try and um come up
with an actual well a fictitious but a
person who's actually doing it to kind
of get out of the realm of you know
listing requirements and you know specs
and things like that and say okay what's
the user experience need to look like
top right template a portion of a user
story is um let me back up so a user
story card um is usually going to
contain um a brief description of the
user story using some kind of a metal
language format like we're suggesting
right here as a user or Persona I want
want this feature so that I can so not
unlike our um estimating session here as
a frequent traveler I want to eat grapes
so I can be healthier in the one that we
uh didn't do uh the inventory system as
a customer okay there's a a user I want
to get cash back so I don't have to wait
in line at the bank okay here's another
user story as a
consumer I want the shopping cart
functionality to easily purchase items
online and maybe that could be customer
as well um as an executive right as a
suit I want to generate a sales report
so I know which departments need to
improve their
productivity as a buyer so you can see I
I tried to come up with these different
roles right here executive buyer sells
rep Etc
um and that's the format as a type of
user I want some kind of goal um or
feature and uh so that's some kind of a
reason um the below that connect connect
the dots by writing all of the user
stories necessary to
uncover the entire use case so like we
were talking about right here if you
want to be able to purchase items online
from a catalog that might be uh multiple
user stories in order to support that
use case and so of course um we would
want to be able to connect the dots and
see where all the user stories fit in
into the overall goal of the project or
release and the stories
um excuse
me um are grouped to form an epic or
higher level story so epic or theme um
stories can then be split into child
stories or task and so that's what we
were covering before right so you have
um
themes up at the top that's the biggest
grouping if you will used primarily
for um you know high level planning
purposes so you have your themes then
you have your epics which are large user
stories um low priority and they're
going to have to be broken down into
smaller user stories like in the
question that we had at the end of the
the last section where um the product
owner needed something done and the team
said well based on the size of this user
story it's going to take three Sprints
to do well a user story has to be small
enough to be completed within a single
Sprint so a Sprint can contain more than
one user story but a user story cannot
span Sprints so that feature or function
that was in the question was probably
more like an epic it was something that
would need to be uh disaggregated into
smaller user stories or perhaps it was
more of a use case that would need more
than one user story in order to actually
deliver the overall use
case let's see as a product supervisor I
want to see an unfinished part
list at the end of the day so that I can
reallocate work the next day great user
story description well done
verage um did you hear that team as a
product supervisor I want to see an
unfinished part list at the end of the
day so I can reallocate work the next
day that is a well-crafted description
of a user
story
now here are some things that I want you
to memorize you were hoping I was done
with the memorization part so I want you
to
um remember that we have to invest in
our user
stories and I was going over to the
Whiteboard and I didn't change cameras
so let me do that I
recommend um you know figuring out how
you memorize best so that you can if um
well not if you wanted to what I
recommend is being able to write out all
of this stuff on plain white scrap paper
in about 14 minutes because that's the
amount of free time you have in the
tutorial when you're at the uh or when
you're taking the test um exen does a
little bit different you maybe won't
have a tutorial the only time you'd have
a tutorial is if you were at a center
taking a test um exen has other options
like you can do a paper based test um uh
where you get a third party you know a
buddy or somebody who will agree to sort
of proor the test for you or you can do
it on your laptop all by yourself and
they have software that watches you
while you're taking the test and they
require you to take the laptop and do
like a 360 so that um they can verify
that you don't have any cheat sheets up
on the wall or anything like that but
the point is is um you got to have this
memorized um whether you're going to
dump it out on the paper or not um when
I took the test um I actually did the
paper based option um and that was
because of some kind time constraints
and it was the quickest way to get me
into the test and so I didn't write out
any of the stuff I'd memorized but I had
it memorized and I had it memorized well
enough that I could kind of recall it in
my mind's eye okay
so we're talking about user stories and
you have to invest in your user stories
you know I like memorizing things by
creating these charts that have the
first
letter of the word or phrase that you're
memorizing in a separate column and then
I make up a story you know that uh um
reminds me that I've got to have I in V
EST this one is pretty easy probably
just invest Works um but so let's go
over that I stands for
independent
independent meaning that each user story
stands on its own um you don't have when
we're doing scrum you don't do a user
story that won't result in working
software we just talked about the
description of user stories right so
it's a user that needs some kind of
functionality for some kind of a reason
and they're all independent will they
work together of course they'll work
together if that's a necessity but um if
you developed a a log on screen you
could demonstrate working software for
the login screen there might be another
user story that is um you know has to do
with displaying uh the catalog and being
able to flag or select items that you
want to purchase but there'd be working
software for that would they work
together yes but each user story would
complete um or result in some kind of
working software and they have to be
independent
negotiable
negotiable in the way the user story is
going to be
implemented the product owner doesn't
dictate to the team the team doesn't say
it it's only this way and we don't want
to hear anything from you so there are
discussions about the size and
implementation for each user user story
so the product owner can't make it so
detailed that there's no room for
discussion and the possibility of you
know the team coming up with Solutions
other than what the product owner was
attempting to
dictate um v stands for
valuable meaning each user story has to
create value for the customer or the end
user e it has to be
estimable as an estimat except estimat
is not really a word it's
estimable um and asses for small has to
be small enough enough to be done in a
single Sprint if we're doing two we
Sprints has to be able to be done in two
weeks or less if we're doing four-week
sprints it could be a larger user story
but it would still uh have to be done in
four weeks or less and then the last one
the t is testable every user story needs
to be testable and it needs to be
testable at two levels remember our
triangle needs to be testable at the
intrinsic quality level unit tests Etc
and also testable at the extrinsic level
which is the customer point of view
which is acceptance so every user story
uh has to be
testable okay so that's invest and so
let's add that to our list of things to
memorize
invest and then the next one we have
here is um the three C's of a user
story so the first C team is
cardred so user stories should be able
to be written on a 4x6 in index card or
some uh media similar to
that
card the the second C is
conversation the user story card is the
item that is used for the team and the
product owner to talk and discuss in
order to make sure that the product
owner and the team are on the same page
when it comes to what is actually
supposed to be developed and um uh what
you know so what it's supposed to look
like at the end which leads us to the
third one which is confirmation
each user story essentially has to have
acceptance tests um in it itself so card
4x6 conversation that's the starting
point that's where uh the team and the
product owner discuss and then
eventually there will be acceptance
tests included on the user story card um
in order to be used during the Sprint
review to um assure that it's acceptable
that there's kind
confirmation okay so oh let's add that
to the memorization
list
so three
C's all right now I've got an example
here of a user story
card so we're looking right
here and if you were to go out on the
internet and search um user story cards
um they would be similar there would be
some differences of course
um but typically what you're going to
have is you're going to have a title or
a name for the user story and then
there's going to be some kind of unique
identifier like user story 321 then
there will be the description like we
just talked about as a librarian I want
to have the facility of searching a book
by different criteria so that I will
save time while serving a
customer then there might be some other
descriptive words or links to other
information that might be necessary and
then there would be acceptance criteria
or tests sometimes these get included on
the back of the card but the point is is
that they are on the cord on the card
rather then there will be an estimate of
size it could be ideal days or story
points as I mentioned most teams do
story points that's more likely what
you'll be tested on as opposed to um
ideal days but you know we'll cover both
so you
understand uh the
differences um there is probably it's
not listed here but there's probably
going to be a
um value point assignment this is where
the product owner um kind of determines
in a relative way the uh value of the
stories just like we were doing in
planning poker the product owner might
say well this story is twice as valuable
as uh this other one comparing them
together and this is what um these value
points are what's used to uh prioritize
the user stories that's supposed to be a
v as in value points and then typically
there's also going to be a indication
sometimes it's just by colors um it
could be words uh that has to do with um
you know where the story came from did
it come from the customer that would be
considered a functional
requirement um if it came from the team
that would be from the technical domain
I'm trying to write where
from uh you know it's not me team it's
the
mouse
clearly it's hard to uh do that that's
from where from um here it's got uh
customer tech you could also have defect
you could maybe have risk um and then
there's also going to be an X
Factor um which would
be some kind of word probably like
um stable um
erratic um
incomplete something like that to uh so
that the team is designating the user
story in uh respect to the amount of
uncertainty or risk that's associated
with that user story and because all of
that's a part of the story right the
story is going to be turned into working
software there may need to be uh some
efforts to actually figure out how to
actually do that user
story so that's the X Factor um over to
the right here on the same chart we have
some comments
about um if you are using a uh software
package excuse me like Trello or jira or
something like that excuse me the user
story cards will generally be able to
contain more information using you know
dynamic links and things like that um
could even include things like
responsible team member or depending on
how you're doing it you would break the
user Story down into tasks and you might
have team members assigned to various
tasks for the user
story um okay so that's typically what a
user story card is like sometimes their
cards sometimes are like on sticky notes
and they're put up on a can band board
if you're using can band to track the
project if you have a story that is too
large to be completed in a Sprint it's
going to have to be subdivided or we
call it disaggregation into um smaller
user stories and there's uh three ways
that we're proposing here that you could
go about doing that you could split it
based on operational boundaries for
example as an operator one needs to
manage reservations which could be split
for example there could be one portion
that is uh that has to do with making a
reservation another one that has to do
with modifying it and yet another one
that has to do with cancelling it so um
that could be split into in this
construct here three separate user
stories you could also separate based on
exceptions or crosscutting concerns for
example in the beginning develop only
one main path like accept repayment for
a
loan then address exceptions like what
if a person um
overpays then um come up with a user
story that recognizes that and processes
a refund and or gives the option of
allocating the overpayment to a future
payment or something like that and then
also um um adds on other concerns like
the tech access restrictions or record
name of operator so maybe um you know
when you're working on uh accepting pay
payments or processing refunds it's
going to check on um who the operator is
or track that so that if at a later time
you know who was it that gave this uh
refund here well you could look and see
you know okay the the operator's name
was recorded or maybe you put some
restrictions so that maybe not everybody
um is allowed to do a refund and so you
would have levels of users that have
different
privileges okay and then down at the
bottom split Based on data boundaries
for an example you know as an accountant
one needs to enter balance sheet
information um which could then be split
into summary
information and separately um uh
receivable details or you know maybe you
could have AP you know so you could have
different portions of the
overall
um balance sheet um activity that need
to be done so enter AR enter
AP
Etc make sense so just to kind of uh
prompt you give you some ideas about
what to do um in a scrum project if you
have the scenario arise where a user
story is being estimated by the team and
it won't fit into a Sprint it's too
big now when it comes to determining
value for user story this is primarily
owned by the uh product owner right and
it always comes back the money but money
you know the value can be looked at from
different points of view so new Revenue
obviously you know getting new customers
and having them buy
stuff um well below that there's another
consideration incremental Revenue uh so
somebody's in the process of placing an
order um maybe they're are some premium
features that could be add-ons at that
point in time um or maybe added later on
so you have an existing customer who
actually
buys um more of or enhanced parts of the
existing thing they already purchased or
are in the process of purchasing
retained value so this is
um you know retaining customers so that
they don't go to a
competitor and then the bottom one is
operational efficiency you know how
could things be done to speed up the
process of whatever it is um so that the
cost of delivering uh the product is
reduced so this then leads us to a
discussion about priorities recognizing
that there are some priority concerns
that come from from both the customer
domain as well as the technical
domain and there are some prioritization
models um if we look right here there is
value based
prioritization and the hierarchy of that
would be high value followed by high
risk followed by high value and then low
risk followed by low value and then low
risk so you know we might have written
this a little bit differently but that's
value based prioritization and this is
primarily the product owner with maybe
some input from the team just simply
deciding um what he or she wants the
most listening to the team say well you
know there's some you know greater risks
with this user story than that and so
you'd probably want to uh persuade the
product owner to take care of high-risk
stuff first um because that would have
an
a uh oh excuse me sorry an impact on the
future things that need to be
done there's the K the Cano model uh
which looks at each of the user stories
and classifies them as being mandatory
linear or
exciters and the mandatory items are
those user stories that are musts and
they'll never move Beyond move the
customer the end user Beyond neutral
it's if they're not there it creates
dissatisfaction if the the you the
product owner and the team has done a
good job in identifying what are the
mandatory or threshold items um you
would see that
um um it just gets it to neutral that's
what's expected for the product linear
items um user stories are those us user
stories that as they are implemented
progressively throughout the project and
added to the feature set it will linear
increase customer satisfaction and it
can be you know in their absence
dissatisfaction all the way up to high
implementation creating a great deal of
satisfaction for the customer and then
the third category is exciters and
delighters um and those are features or
functions those are user stories that
are not mandatory and the absence of
them will never result in satisfaction
going below neutral but by adding them
um you could create excitement and
Delight for the customer these would
typically be things that
are features that would be included in a
premium version of the product or maybe
add-ons that are promoted you know at
the point of sale you know if you
thought about this because it'll really
help you or whatever
so that's the canal model and then
there's weager relative waiting method
and um this is all using numbers so each
feature is given a value for its benefit
and it's penalty given a value for
penalty meaning what's the pain if that
feature or function is not
included and then there is um um the
cost side and the risk
side and then those are all calculated
together and that results
in excuse me a ranking or a hierarchy
which gives you the uh priority for the
uh user
stories um we also talked about Moscow
didn't we did we talk about Moscow uh
Moscow is another prioritization model
must could
I said that differently must should
could won't Moscow mscw must should
could
won't and we talked about that one thank
you for that
confirmation does it seem like a long
time ago or is it just me I know it was
just last weekend but it's like last
year okay so now let's talk about
velocity um uh prianka that is exactly
right
um so velocity is the capacity of the
team to
complete work in a single
iteration so the team has estimated the
user stories uh for size or ideal days
and um the Sprints are going to be three
week weeks in duration obviously not all
user stories can be be completed in a
single Sprint and be done with the
project well I guess maybe I shouldn't
say Obviously when I'm saying that I'm
thinking well maybe you had a very small
short duration project so you could but
the point is is that uh it's the team's
capacity to um complete work in a given
Sprint and it
is an observation it's not a prediction
so if we're working on Sprint
five and we're working on determining
what our velocity
is then um it would be the average of
the previous four
Sprints if there were any uh outliers
You' you would uh disregard
those
um and so it's an
observation if we look over to question
or uh box number two here velocity is
used to deal with um determining how
many user stories we are going to
include in a given Sprint and also how
many Sprints are we going to need to
create a release or a set of user
stories and here's an
example in box number three a team
completed five user stories that were
sized 5
38 1
and
two two user stories each sized five
were left half complete what is the
velocity of the
team and the answer is either going to
be 31 or
36 31 is the sum of the completed user
stories um if you were 36 you were
claiming half of the two that were five
five uh so that would be a total of 10
so you claim half of it which would be
five would take you to
36 but it's not going to be 36 because
the only thing that counts
towards progress is working software so
even if the team had finished nine out
of 10 story points for a user story
meaning it's almost done and then the
Sprint ends that doesn't get counted
towards
velocity and you don't mess around with
velocity um you can mess around with
your
estimating and you can mess around with
um you know what user stories are going
to be completed in a Sprint but you
don't the the velocity is not variable
it is what it is based on past
performance when it comes to levels of
planning we have What's called the
planning onion and let me walk you
through through this here up at the the
broadest area is the vision level so the
vision level that's the suits right
they're the ones that have the strategy
and objectives for the company and where
it's going and so they have that overall
big vision for the uh
company which is likely going to include
products and each product should have a
road map my example of that website that
I'm uh working on has has uh three
versions um which make up the product
road map version one is the free site
version two is the membership site and
version three is the um uh the pay
referral commissions uh uh version of
the site and the product road map is
then supported by
releases so for my project I have three
releases so all of the user stories
needed for the free version are in
release one all of the additional user
stories that are needed for the um uh
paid version the subscriber
version uh and then also for version
three those are all releases three
releases and then for each Sprint we
will be pulling user stories from the
release that we're working on a release
is likely going to take multiple Sprints
and um and then the Sprints are
populated by the individual user stories
which are then disaggregated into
tasks and we do the excuse me the daily
scrum which is the daily level of
planning and coordination so we call
that the planning
onion we already kind of talked about
the release and road map um concept here
so let's just review this quickly um
priories high level epics and determine
goals and releases so we'll use epics
and themes in order to group things
together you know what should be
included in what release so what are the
goals for the releases then the first
bullet point establish goals of release
based on market demand regulatory needs
or customer
expectations for each release you want
to estimate the target
stories repeat until the target stories
are assigned and iteration
length
I should that's it's blending some
things here um be able to estimate
velocity and then uh assign stories to
the Sprints so we keep estimating the
user stories and we keep organizing uh
that until we can do that we can come up
with an iteration length or Sprint
length and then figure out what our
velocity for each Sprint is and then uh
assign stories to the uh the Sprints uh
the the next bullet down iterate until
the user stories and release date meets
conditions of satisfaction so that's uh
definition of done or acceptance for the
release and try not to pack too much
into a release backlog
so
um just like you would not want to pack
too many user stories into a Sprint you
want to have the timelines appropriate
and uh what are included in the uh
events uh make
sense okay so here's a bit more about
release planning on this slide here um
you've got the product backlog here on
the left and then we might come up with
a release plan which could be flipped
and could be looked at uh
horizontally and you probably plan um
about three releases in advance uh um or
at least you're doing more of the
detailed planning on that uh because
things are going to emerge when we do
you know Sprint one that's going to help
in Sprint two and things that happen in
Sprints one and two that are going to
help um release three and then you've
got um you know your subsequent releases
where we're just doing very high level
planning it's called rolling wave
planning where we do detailed planning
for things in the future in tandem with
doing high level planning for things in
uh the future did I say that right
detail planning for things in the near
term in tandem with high LEL planning
for things in the
future um and we talked about deciding
as late as possible I believe meaning
that it's better to actually plan the
later uh
releases uh for purposes
of uh making sure we have more
information uh the most information
available okay so s
estimation let's start at the top left
the principles behind estimation
understand the cone of
uncertainty which is an estimate or best
guess to begin with and then
progressively becomes more accurate in
fact let's just take a break and look at
the cone of uncertainty so at the very
beginning of a project there's going to
be a high level of
uncertainty um if I were to draw this
chart I would make it a little bit more
like
this so clearly you're going to drisk
the
project as early as you can and then
eventually all risk disappears when the
project is done risk is
uncertainty okay below that the only
estimate that matters is the one given
by the
teen supported by this uh comment here
nothing is impossible for the one who
doesn't have to do it so the product
owner is like team come on you can do
this the team's like no we know what our
velocity is no the product owner says
I'm telling you there's no way that that
can't be done I know you can do it I
trust you I believe in
you but the product owner doesn't have
to do have to do the work okay top right
overestimate and underestimation is
always going to be an issue that we deal
with it's more likely that we will
underestimate than
overestimate and by looking at our
velocity from iteration or Sprint to
Sprint um there could be some
information that is um showing us that
we're underestimating for example
meaning um we're we're thinking we you
know the user stories are smaller than
they are and that we can get you know a
certain number done in the Sprint and
then there's a fail well that would mean
then that would be discussed during the
retrospective and then we would do
something different going forward which
might include doing some reestimating
scrum estimating is not necessarily more
difficult however scrum exposes bad
estimates sooner which is a good thing
when we were doing our um
uh planning poker you can see that um
the first time as a team you know we
didn't know each other we didn't know
everybody's thoughts and concerns and
those kinds of things you know get
shared and absorbed as a project goes on
and so there's a higher awareness of
that so um what we would say is that um
using estimation techniques scrum
estimation techniques might be uh more
inaccurate at the beginning of a project
but they will quickly become very
accurate as the um project advances
forward let's see is there a question
here can velocity be increased over a
period of time for the project yes it
can now it's not that it can't it will
increase if the team is learning how to
work together better and better you
would expect that if I could just use my
mouse here if we were
tracking velocity so this would be um
points completed over here uh let me
just do pts for points and down here is
time and we go from Sprint to Sprint
right you would expect that maybe you
know the first couple of Sprints the
team would be learning how to work
together and there would be a steep
curve and then it would kind of flatten
out and maybe have you know a slow rise
going forward as the team emerges as a
high performing team they get better at
their cross uh functional Behavior you
know somebody's the team just keeps
chugging along um other things you know
just um oh
sorry there I bumped the thing on my
screen there
um um so the team you know learns how to
work better together and you know their
estimates become more accurate Etc and
you would expect a high per a high
performing team to have a uh a result
like this for velocity where there's
quick Improvement and then it kind of
stabilizes and then begins to tick
upwards okay we talked about the cone of
uncertainty let's talk about ideal time
um when we do estimating for user
stories um we do it in ideal days when
we do estimating for tasks we do it in
ideal time which means hours I think
that's on the Whiteboard or it was on
the Whiteboard oh it was on it um so
ideal time is the amount of time it
takes to complete a piece of work
but that's based
on the notion
that the team member or members are
available to do just the work with no
distractions or anything at all so
assuming that um prian could sit down at
a keyboard and code for 8 hours without
taking a break for lunch no phone calls
no discussions no meetings of any kind
just work eight hours how much could be
done in that eight hours by Priyanka
that's what ideal time is but the thing
of it is is that there is no such thing
as somebody being able to spend every
minute of every day only doing work
there will be um
distractions so it has to be be
converted into a lapse time now we don't
convert it to aapse time at the user
story level but we do convert it to
aapse time when we are dealing at the
task
level and what that looks like is you
know for each team member you're going
to have to do it separately because some
team members have more distractions than
others some might have other duties that
pull them away um whatever the case may
be um you Det determine how much time in
a given day a team member is available
to do work so say it's 5 hours out of
eight for one maybe it's six hours out
of eight for another maybe it's four out
of eight but you figure out what it is
and then you take the average and that
average availability is used then to
convert Ideal Time into elapse
time um I should have circled this box
because we talked about this as well um
and then I already mentioned this here
only considers actual work time not the
distractions so that's the concept of
Ideal time when it comes to story points
it's different than that they are a
measure of size relative to each other
so we were doing planning poker this
morning where um we were looking at
grapes versus apples and then we were
looking at oranges and and what else do
we have watermelons and coconuts and we
weren't trying to figure out how much
time it would take to eat grapes as
opposed to how much time it would uh
take to eat a coconut it's clear that
it's going to take longer to eat a
coconut because there's more effort
involved so we have a sense that it's
going to take more time but comparing
the coconut to our Baseline of two right
we came up with a baseline of two for
the smallest user Story We compare
eating C to that Baseline and we say
okay you know what it's going to take
more effort to uh eat the coconut than
it is to eat grapes or
apples um so you can do it like we did
you can also
triangulate um for example when we did
our planning project this morning or
this morning for me rather at the
beginning um oh that's not it that is
the daily standup here it is
is if I had said Team I want you to pick
a small user story a medium user story
and a large user
story um and then we would then compare
other stories to those three and so we
would kind of triangulate on it um let's
say that we did uh you know two was
small uh I'm sorry I'm saying that wrong
grapes was small apples were medium and
coconuts were large well if we then
looked at Orange and we said well you
know orange
is um smaller than Apples but bigger
than grapes so we would know this would
fit in between grapes and
apples
um and so let's say you know we had
apples at five and grapes at two then we
would say an orange is probably going to
be
three and the value use you know now I
used um in our example the modified
Fibonacci series uh what we do in scrum
and Adel if we're using story points
we're going to use um a nonlinear scale
for the values so down at the
bottom here there's the modified
Fibonacci Sequence the way the Fibonacci
sequence works by the way
um um it's
the
the value is the sum of the two on the
right so let me break this right here
because this is a modified Fibonacci so
13 is 5 + 8 8 is 3 + 5 5 is 2+ 3 and 3
is 1 + 2 if we were doing the real
Fibonacci series this wouldn't be 20 it
would be 13 + 8 which would be
21 um and I don't know why some use
modified Fibonacci and others not but
that's just kind of a common thing to do
if you're doing planning poker you give
everybody seven cards one two 3 58 13
and
20 um another nonlinear scale is
doubling
12486 um you typically don't go too far
to the left with the values because um
that either means that you're being too
granular or you've got stories that are
probably too big and they need to be
disaggregated now somebody just chatted
here um should some suffer time be
included in the actual
estimates
um let me answer that question first by
going back to Ideal time and then I'm
going to come back to story points and
answer the question when we're
estimating in ideal time we don't add a
special amount of time that we would
call a buffer we just allow for the
distractions and the interruptions which
could look like a buffer right you're
saying you know um you know prianka if
um based on your duties in the
organization and our uh workday of eight
hours you're typically available to be
doing your project work five out of
those eight hours so when we are
converting ideal time to elapse time um
you know we will be building in extra
time based on distractions and
interruptions we would not call it a
buffer but that's essentially what we're
doing now when it comes the user stories
that we're using story points it is
different um the points are for the
entire amount of the work and why might
we need to have some extra time for a
user story well it's likely going to be
driven by uncertainty there might be
other uh things that impact it but
that's the main
thing sorry
team so when the team is estimating the
size of the user story they will be
including in their discussion and
estimates any extra time or buffer time
that would be needed for uh that user
story to be completed so do we
accommodate um uncertainty when we're
using story points yes we're looking at
the The X Factor and if we've got an
unstable user story then we're probably
going to um say you know this is going
to be a bigger user story than one
that's similar but has a a much lesser
level of
uncertainty um so that's the story
points let's compare the
two um Ideal Time uses things like hours
and days which is easier to explain
outside the team right the suits like
things in days and hours everybody's
estimate may be different not a bad
thing it's easier to do at the beginning
because we're oriented to think about
time um and it does kind of shine a
light on wasted time story
points um are harder to explain outside
the team um you know the suit says well
um how long is it going to take to do
user story 301 and our answer is um well
that's a 10 user story Point user story
and the suit's saying what does that
mean tell me how long it's going to take
um so the suits have to be converted to
uh uh story points now here's the thing
it's a lot easier to get consensus when
we're estimating in story points and
once we get good at it it's going to be
much
faster we have to remember it's not
comparable across teams so you know a
team working together will have its own
kind of system for for sizing the
stories and another team that might even
be working on the same project will have
a CO a whole different uh scheme and so
if the velocity of one team is 25 and
the velocity of another is 50 it doesn't
mean that the team with the velocity of
50 is able to do more work than the
teams whose velocity is
25 and we did um when we got our day
going um we started with um uh a
planning poker exercise and so you know
we used all of the team members so we
selected the team the product owner was
there to answer any questions um the
team discussed each of the story cards
and then um decided what their vote was
going to be and then everybody voted at
once if there were outliers they were
discussed and um the reasons for that uh
those variances those outliers um were
then part of the discussion and then we
did another round of voting and we would
keep doing that until we had our
estimates converge or we reached
consensus on
that okay so advantages of planning
poker it's fun it's quick it gets the
whole team involved the the team
understands um a little bit about all of
the stories everybody contributes his or
her expertise and the discussion during
the estimation provides Clarity in the
direction approach and even a bit of
design if we were in the same room team
and we were doing a planning poker
activity like we did uh at the beginning
of our day uh together um we would be
able to you know model it a little bit
better or if we tried to unmute
everybody but you could hear the
background noise I've tried doing it it
doesn't really work but you get the idea
that if the team's discussing and things
like that you would actually get to the
point where um your estimates would
converge and the team would say okay
this user story size is you know
whatever it
is okay so we need to wrap things up for
the day so we are ending right here and
that means tomorrow when we get together
we're going to be doing slide 20 we
starting with that which is Affinity
estimating and let's see Affinity
estimating we go through that we're
going to talk about tracking progress
using um information radiators and then
we're going to talk about what we do
when we find variances between the plan
and the actual results and then we'll
have our quiz so we're almost finished
um I think we're good on time so are you
interested in becoming an agile scrum
professional here we have certified
scrum Master CSM certification training
course so hurry up and enroll Now find
the cost Link in the description box now
let us look at a typical scenario of an
organization where the need of user
stories would come in so looking at this
scenario so an organization would have a
scenario where the existing products are
sold very well in the market and uh they
may think about introducing new product
or they may think about introducing a
new feature or functionality to the
existing product so the scenario what we
are considering is it says our previous
product sold really well in the market
now let's think about new products so
we'll need to make sure we can
understand the require requirments and
fulfill their requirements now how do
you do this so how are you going to
understand the consumer requirements
user requirements and how is that going
to help the user to accomplish their
requirement and fulfill the need
whatever it's required to be fulfilled
so user story helps one who understand
the user stories would look at the
perspective of the users and these user
stories provides those inside towards
what user would exist so as we go
through we will understand in the
perspective of the users the
requirements and how user stories helps
in terms of fulfilling those
requirements this requires certain
amount of visualization let us see what
it is so what are user stories user
stories are an agile software
development project management tool that
provides users with simple natural
language explanations of one or more
features written from the end users
perspectives so for for a given product
we may have many end users so we may
develop an application within an
organization and use that application
for an organization that is one scenario
second scenario is we create a product
we sell it and employees of our customer
organization will become users of those
products these are the two scenarios so
having these scenarios what kind of
product it is what is the objective of
this product which is going to fulfill
so let me assume an HR application which
is used for submission of claims from
the employees so what is that
requirement so these application should
accept the claims submission from the
employees of the organization and then
that needs to be processed and the
claims needs to be uh clear now what
will happen now the user Community if
you visualize there is an user as an
employee of an organization who submit
claims so there is an user in the
finance perspective who is going to
deposit the money similar L there is an
user who is going to approve so many
such user interfaces we will see the
existence of the roles of users we will
see who would be using these particular
applications so in their perspective
there should be an interface provided
there should be some privileges provided
through which they would do their
transactions and activities when we
raise the user stories we don't write
them in detail so a user story doesn't
go in detail it just mentions how a
certain type of work will bring value to
end user so what is this role specific
end user would be doing at that
particular role in this particular
product what is the transactions
involved so the end user in this case
could mean external end user or even
internal customer or colleagues within
the organization so looking at these
points if I look at the same application
HR claim processing application who are
this internal users the employees of
organization so who are these external
maybe the people who sold this
particular application to our
organization so they have installed it
they manage it there is an
Administration role for this particular
product that is a role similarly another
set of internal users maybe someone who
is like from Finance from HR so in each
of these roles perspective this
particular product should provide the
interface and then there should be a
transaction in their perspective which
is very important so user story should
explain this in very brief so that it
helps in terms of visualizing what kind
of interface has to be provided and why
would this particular role use it that
is very important so user stories also
form the building block of agile
Frameworks like epics and initiatives so
what is this epics what is this
initiatives let us look at it now epics
refers to the group of user stories
where the large amount of work broken
down into user stories so many user
stories together forms epics which will
provide certain Insight towards how
these user stories are connected with
each other so similarly initiative
refers to combination of multiple epics
forming that initiatives so which is
very essential to group so managing
perspective it will become easy and also
looking at the objective what is that
particular group of user stories group
of epics are going to accomplish so user
stories can also help ensuring that team
work to goals of the organization
through epics and initiatives it should
be looking at the objective exactly what
is the directions we are getting into
and how these combination of user
stories so as an employee I'm submitting
my claims so what is that required in
that users perspective there should be
story so I as a finance person I'm going
to clear these claims I'm going to pay
the money deposit the money so that is
that particular role needs certain
interfaces and that visualization
requires how this interactions happens
so user story should help in terms of
understanding those so the requirements
for making user story a reality are
added later after discussing with the
team so we made an user story we created
an user story it doesn't end there so
there needs to be a discussion which
happens further to decide yes it is a
valid user story so this will also helps
in terms of prioritization which needs
to be taken up first so user stories are
recorded on post it notes or an index
card or a project management software
and this would help in terms of
prioritization or for tracking as well
so what is the advantages of user
stories so advantages of user story
involves it helps in delivering high
quality content because what is required
to be accomplished in the user
perspective that will be very
clear EES collaboration with team
members because finalization on the user
stories and understanding of the user
requirements would happen after
discussing with the team members each
one would give their own uh viewpoints
and uh prioritization of particular user
story or keeping a specific user story
or not considering that user story would
be based on the feedback which team
provides this cannot happen in terms of
having team members together and
speaking about it helps understanding
users better so user roles are discussed
users requirement is discussed and what
is that they're going to accomplish
through this user
interface that is also discussed so user
role is understood user requirement is
clearly understood by writing an user
story this will also help in improving
transparency because since the
collaboration is happening since the
user story is not just taken just like
that the discussion happens and that
will have an interaction and
collaboration so definitely improves
transparency so now it reduces risks so
when I say risk it's obviously
uncertainty
so it reduces risk because the clarity
one would have about the requirement of
users so accordingly the features
functionality of the product are defined
so that they can fulfill those user
requirements then supports iterative
developments as I mentioned earlier the
collaboration the transparency everyone
working together and in the agile
perspective users stories epics and
initiatives gets into the specific
iterations only after this discussion
with the team members and after
prioritizing it so the user story will
be there in the product backlogs which
will be prioritized based on that
particular scenario of requirement in
agile scenario so as when we say agile
it's quite obvious we need to be
flexible to the changing scenarios so
since we're working together and when we
go for an iterative mode of approach is
quite obvious we're going for it to get
adopting to the changing scenario so
that we can select that particular
features functionality by pulling that
particular epic or user story as a
priority in the given list so that
prioritization making will also become
easier focuses on oal Communications
means lot of interactions happens while
discussing on user stories so since
people are doing it o so there is some
Personal Touch also established good
collaboration can get established so us
story also provides that visibility
because of that people working together
in a collaborative manner invest
in user stories so what is invest so
investing in user stories so what does
that mean so it is a concept that helps
creating meaningful user stories so it
stands for independent negotiable
valuable
esteemable sized appropriately testable
so when I say
independent so whenever we write the
user story that should be
selfcontained if at all possible to
avoid dependencies on other user stories
so it should be independent of one
another so that each of them can be
developed and delivered
separately so negotiable so when we say
negotiable user stories can always be
changed or r- return so at any given
point in time so we should be able to do
the modifications required so that
should support the flexibility
associated with the agile methodologies
so since requirements often evolve
changes and this changes comes for
various different reasons so how do we
change this user stories or modify this
so that it can fit into the requirement
so that adaption can happen to the
changing requirements so story should be
discussible and should be open for
negotiation for any change scenarios so
next valuable when I say valuable it's
quite obvious we're speaking about value
what is being created for the users or
consumers so a user story would rep
the goal or an objective an end user who
is going to look for means value is
always in the consumer's perspective so
now I created certain features
functionality is fine but did that
really create the value to the consumers
so the value realization plays an
important role So Stories must ensure
there's a value being added to the
consumers and customers or users always
otherwise user story doesn't make any
sense so estimable so when we say
estimable one should always be able to
to estimate the size of the user story
so sometimes developers may not have the
experience required to size the
particular situations or needed for an
user story reasons may be anything it
may be not having specific Insight
towards it or don't know how to estimate
there may be someone specific who needs
to understand the scenarios and then
come and discuss reasons may be anything
so stories if they cannot estimate then
it will become difficult in terms of
handling it better so it should give
some visualization so it should be
estimable and can be divided into tasks
so now small means sized appropriately
so user story should not be very big or
should not be too small and then uh how
do we decide on this size so now when we
say any user story that can be completed
by a developer in single iterations then
can we call it as two big quite
obviously that is an indicative so user
story should be subdivided into two or
more small stories into multiple pieces
multiple stories small small stories so
that it can be handled better so story
should not be too big and should be
completed within 40 hours or 3 to 4 days
this numbers are indicative so not
necessarily you should be fixing with
these numbers so just an indicative to
show you that what would be the focus
when I say us the story in what is that
effort it would take to accomplish that
now
testable so when we say user story is
testable one has to ensure that
development is complete and has been
done correctly so means one once you
create a user story so that needs to be
articulated in such a way so that it
becomes measurable when it's a testable
obviously there should be metrics a
Target metric which can be created which
will help me to State yes this
particular requirement is accomplished
so they should have an acceptance
criteria that can be tested to check if
they fulfill the customers need so then
how to write user story this is very
important an point to look at so how to
write the user story so writing user
stories comes up with a specific
template with a simple language so what
is it so now as a role I want to so that
so you keep filling it so typically role
means what the specific user role who
would be using that particular product
and their requirements which are being
fulfilled so that is the role the name
of the role we are going to put it here
so the role refers to an individual that
would be interfacing or interacting with
the system now uh want to when we say
want to the want or action which
represents the behavior of the systems
so what is that it's supposed to do this
action would be unique to each user
stories now so that this refers to the
benefits or results that nonfunctional
and external to the system as a result
what would happen what is that we are
trying to accomplish out of it so let us
look at an example how does it look like
as a CEO I want to track my subordinates
progress to ensure organizations goals
are met similarly if we take the
reference to those examples what we
discussed earlier like we took the
example of HR portal so claim processing
requirement now this can be same user
story as an employee of an organization
what can I write so as an employee of
this
organization I want to submit my claims
online so that claim processing will
become smoother easier faster without
any errors so that can also be an user
story so it gives certain visualization
what kind of users are there and what is
that they need so the moment you write
the user stories you should visualize
that rule it is very important so there
is three CES of user stories which we uh
call it as card then uh conversation and
then confirmation so when we say card
card provides a written description of
the user story so what do I mean by
written description of the user story so
same thing the user story what we just
saw as an example so that can be written
on a card so this will help in planning
and estimating so what that will also
gives that visualization of users and
their requirement so that that can be
articulated further and also estimated
so that it can uh looked in the
perspective of invest what is invest
What would discussed so it is
independent it is negotiable it is
valuable it is estimable it is sized
appropriately means it's not should not
be too big too small the examples what
we saw was appropriate and testable so
now when we see this particular user
story is it fulfilling all those points
what we discussed in invest that is very
important now this card whatever the
description is provided should elaborate
on that very clearly so then further
what happens
conversation after the user story is
written in a card and given and it is
shared with every individuals who is
participating in that conversation so
then there will be discussion so
conversation represents discussion
between users team product owners so
this helps in terms of whatever the user
story is written is it making sense is
it in line with the user's expectation
and at the same time what whatever the
understanding we have maybe as a product
owner or the team member a developer is
my understanding correct then user
perspective so whatever the user story
is written is that user story is
speaking about the requirement which
needs to be fulfilled as they require so
this helps to build a shared
understanding between all those
individuals so that there is no
confusion further so once people
Converse together once the stakeholders
Converse together then you will confirm
confirmation so this represents the
condition that need to be satisfied to
ensure that the Story meets all
requirements so you are confirming so
all the stakeholders are agreeing to
that so firstly to summarize this 3 C's
refers to card conversation confirmation
card provides the user stories which
actually represents as we took an
examples which will capture that so that
it also fulfills the thought of invest
then then uh conversation is required to
understand what is this user story is
speaking about is that a real
requirement so confirmation further in
terms of confirmation from users as well
as all the stakeholders before you go
and develop or execute that so what is
life cycle of user story so when we say
life cycle so we may require to
understand a life cycle starts when you
conceptualize when you visualize when
you say this is what we may require to
accomplish they should be conceiving
someone should conceive that idea here
so it may be related to a problem it may
be related to a specific product for an
opportunity what is seen so whatsoever
the reason it is there is a scenario
where something is conceived trigger may
be a problem trigger may be some issues
what is being faced trigger may be an
opportunity what is seen so then the
initiative the trigger which actually
pushed towards creation of the
requirements and user stories so the
life cycle of user stories starts from
there so how does it go so it
involves right from the point pending to
to-do then discussion then developing
confirming and then finished so when I
say pending I'm basically saying user
stories in their most basic forms where
they are created after communicating
with the user and the project team these
acts as the reminder for further
discussion so first level of
understanding on user stories in the
basic form so which will help in terms
of further discussion and taking a call
on that so will there be a possibility
that this user stories will be modified
as we progress answer is yes and no both
so it may be modified but discussion is
further which goes on uh from this basic
understanding of that particular user
story so further discussion is to
elaborate on that make sense out of it
and confirm so then after discussion
with the stakeholders users stories that
need to be addressed are decided and put
into Sprints so in between the point
where we said pending to too so in
between this there is a lot of
discussion so where decision is
happening here so decided and put into
Sprints means there is a prioritization
also which is happening so now
discussion at this stage user confirms
users confirms the requirement and
acceptance
criterias so acceptance criterias helps
in terms of
once you test that particular user story
after executing you will check based on
these acceptance criteria so that you
can conclude the requirement is
fulfilled the end users are shown a
preview of upcoming features so that
they understand yes this is what we were
expecting they can provide their
feedbacks necessary feedbacks or
insights whatever is required to be
provided so then once the discussion is
complete the team would be able to
design and Implement features to fulfill
user requirements so once user concludes
yes this is what we were expecting and
there is a sign off during the
discussion then features are developed
and implemented so that it can goes to
that product which can be used so then
after developing confirming so the end
user confirms the user story features
are confirmed to testing environments
Alpha versions and acceptance criterias
are looked at before saying yes it is
confirmed user is accepting so that will
happen as part of confirming means that
features or functionality what was
written in user story so that specific
users are using it and concluding or
acknowledging yes this is fulfilling our
requirement and this is according to the
acceptance criteria what we discussed
and agreed so that is very important so
we write a user story fine but users are
not agreeing to it that is not a good
scenario to be with user should accept
and confirm then finished so the user
story is completed at this stage for new
require ments or new features a new user
story must be created any new features
or new functionality I'm required to add
to this particular product then I would
write another user story and the same
life cycle starts continues and this is
not an ending thing so as I keep
modifying the features as I add new
features and I as I look at improving
the performances so I keep writing the
user stories now one question keeps
coming to me so we write a user story
while fulfilling the requirements fine
as a specific user I want this easy to
narrate that so how are you going to
look at a scenario where there is an
improvement of something so whenever we
are going to discuss about Improvement
of something it is quite obvious we need
to look at it what is that Improvement
user is looking at now when I'm am uh
submitting a particular request or
accessing something it is taking some
time means there is some delay now user
experience can be enhanced by reducing
that particular time that is Improvement
as a user the user story basic user
story doesn't change but in the
performance perspective you may require
to visualize that so problem statement
has to come in accordingly user story
has to be articulated then once the user
story is written it is required to put
the user story mapping so user story
mapping represents and arranges user
stories that help with understanding the
systems functionalities the systems
backlog planning releases and providing
value to the customers so typically this
involves arranging or organizing user
stories based on the priority along the
horizontal axis so I will horizontally
when you move so you will say which one
is the priority which user stories are
priority first thing which I need to
focus on so vertical Arrangements
represents how in the given specific
user Story how the activities
perspective task perspective subtask
perspective further down how it gets
elaborated to improving the levels how
it goes forward so now let us look at an
user story mapping with an example of
let me say net banking services provided
by a bank for account holders when I say
net banking service it is quite obvious
it is also has to be provided through
having a product uh which banking
application would use so but here we
need to visualize the users Journey
while accessing the net banking portal
viewing the Account Details paying bills
like utility bills doing lot of
transactions within that particular
portal net banking access the moment
they do like generating statements or
transferring money to one of the benef
beneficiaries Etc so the all this
transactions what is being done so in
this user story map let us see how does
it look like so few activities are
considered here like uh logging into the
account means net banking portal will
come in then one would input their
credentials and then the login now that
journey of the users in a specific
activity what they do is visualized Now
log to account in the sense obviously
one has to go to that portal so go to
login page then enter credentials login
ID and password so once that login ID
and password is entered obviously there
is a process engine which runs behind to
provide the necessary access now if that
credentials are not uh working or if I
don't remember it reset password is an
option immediately now as I go through
further from this subtask in all the
particular columns which I have given
you as you go through this as I deep
dive into it further it goes on so until
the person gets an access to the account
and then start doing the transactions it
goes up to that level so I can keep
writing the subtask further so manage
account so you would go to account page
once you access it then you'll select
the specific account because you may
have many different account types which
is there with the bank you may be having
one or many so in the scenario you have
more than one obviously you will select
that account and Account Details will be
displayed to you so this user will not
do but user will get that so we are
visualizing that and further after
Account Details are displayed what user
would do then further you would keep
visualizing that so some of the
transaction like generate rating
statement transferring money so even for
that the steps are written so going to
statement page then selecting the
account for which you need a statement
then selecting the period from when to
when the statement one is requiring and
then uh further clicking on it and
downloading that particular statement or
choosing an options mentioning that I
need this in an email or I need an OD
copy of this so similarly transferring
money so you will go to that specific
page where you need to transfer the
money so you may have the beneficiary
there in the list already added if you
have added earlier or newly you're
adding a beneficiary so there are
various types of transfers like so
International transfer you will have
local domestic transfer you will have
within a bank uh accounts being within
the same bank bank a two consumers so
from me if I'm a consumer transferring
money to another consumer of the same
bank and vice versa that is one of the
options second is a bank consumer having
an transferring a money to some other
bank account of someone else that is
another scenario or transferring money
for my own account in another bank so
various different scenarios you come
across so then limitation or depending
on what kind of beneficiaries are these
what is the limitations and how are you
going to authenticate them so the moment
I visualize a specific transaction and
activities of user stories what are the
things an user can do then I can keep
writing mapping this to each of those
flow and see how the flow happens so
this flow helps me to bring in all those
features and functionality and also
prioritizing them so can I say the
beneficiary option would be the basic
thing which consumer would give I think
initially if I go back when actually net
banking features were provided by the
bank the basic thing was just viewing
the account that was the given statement
download was given otherwise there was
no opportunity to transfer money there
was no opportunity to do something
beyond that so now now as we see today
the lot of flexibility has brought in
with lot of new features functionalities
in the net banking or mobile banking
options so they evolve so as they evolve
it is quite obvious we may require to
keep adding those features functionality
by rating the user stories this is how
the enhancement happens so overall if
you look at user story mapping helps in
terms of understanding not just the user
story of one transaction Associated
transaction in the user story what
happens through the journey that will
help so this will also support to
understand and visualize what needs to
be created to ultimately give that
access to the user so the end to end
flow should be visualized and also needs
to be prioritization and has to be
looked at as well now what are the
advantages of user story mapping so the
advantages wise helps with prioritizing
work as I explained in the example
similarly the focus is on user value the
moment I click click on web page
www.abc
bank.com now the bank page will come I
will have an interface of login I'll go
and click on login now from the point I
open a browser and input that URL and
then click on login and login page comes
in how long it takes so there are many
things which is involved the browser
things are involved the system from
which the person is accessing is
involved so removing that part so
thinking that both of them working well
and what should be the response from the
server with where this particular
website is hosted that experience needs
to be looked at so that's how you look
at a user value in the transaction now
once I put a credentials now how quickly
the authentication happens what are the
checks the bank portal does to ensure
that the person who is logging in as is
a genuine user is it just a password is
there any capture codes is there any OTP
sent or is there any secret code the
person has to put in so likewise many
things are involved while giving that
experience to the user so and today's
user if you just put in various
different checks points they understand
because they are well educated so why
all those things like capture or OTP
scenario scheming so these are came in
because more and more informed the
people has become then their ability to
hack also improved so more and more
levels added to ensure that only that
genuine user will enter the user account
similarly when you visualize any product
and user journey in the user's
interest what are the things which is
going to create value that needs to be
understood so only that experience will
help for the user to realize the benefit
then road blocks are highlighted so as
we visualize this journey so this will
tell me so what would stop me to move
forward is there any concerns is there
any constraints like for example if you
want to activate a beneficiary but for
some limited period you can only send
the limited amount of money why is that
done by chance if the beneficiary is
added by that individual who is not a
genuine user so we are actually holding
it right so by the time that freezing
time whatever is given so by the time
the message goes to the actual consumer
telling that there is a user activated
like this and if at all if it is not a
genuine user obviously the person can
call to the bank saying that this is not
the uh beneficiary which I have added
there's something which is not correct
so they are giving that space so how did
they visualize this has to be done so as
we looked at the Journey of adding a
beneficiary it's quite obvious when
beneficiary is added if by chance
someone who is not authorized adds it so
who is going to disbenefit obviously
user will be dis benefited so that
blocks that constraints are visualized
similarly in making or creating that
features functionality what should be
the basic features or in the product
should be ready only then I can add this
feature even that will be visible right
so roadblock will be highlighted and
that those will be made visible so that
easy for you to move forward
prioritizing and ensuring that it goes
in the flow required to accomplish that
value so then ensuring team unity
because everyone will have an
visualization user stories and mapping
reads a lot of discussion brings the
people to have a common understanding so
obviously that Unity the collaboration
would come in focus on constant
Improvement so Improvement is the key
whatever you do you have just adopted a
waterfall methodology you have just
adopted an agile you write user stories
you write a pics you write bring in that
various different methods to do
something whatever you do whether it's
product or a service or a process or
specific uh transactions task reports
whatever we make so all that should help
in terms of identifying the
opportunities for improvement and making
that improvements that is very important
agile project management as a name
suggests is a flexible approach to
building a project in agile project
management the project is broken down
into several stages or Sprints agile
does not work on the principle of
delivering the final product at the end
of the project it works on delivering
sections of a project or mini projects
the process of project management in the
case of agile is agile based so there
won't be any central control of project
manager as it was there in the
traditional way of working before we
move forth let's have a look at the
Agile development cycle agile
methodologies consist of several small
Cycles or Sprints at the end of each
stage we get a mini project there's a
product backlog that explains new
features changes in the existing
features and several other improvements
in the project then we have a Sprint
backlog which has a list of tasks that
are to be completed during each Sprint
the Sprint consists of planning
designing execution testing and
deployment stages and at the end of each
Sprint a mini project is delivered with
every Sprint new features are added to
the product which plays a significant
role in the overall project growth after
all the Sprints and early validation in
the development a final deliverable has
a fewer chances of failure let's now
have a look at some reasons why
Industries have started moving towards
agile project management the first
reason is high product quality when we
talk about high product quality we refer
to the build of the product as per
stakeholders demands testing is
performed at Short intervals of time
wherever needed to ensure high quality
of the product then another reason is
customer satisfaction whatever is done
in the project is known by the customer
the deliveries don't take longer
durations as they used to take in the
case of traditional ways the changes may
be provided by the customer in the
execution phase of the project third
reason is reduced risk since the project
is divided into Sprints so if the risk
affects one Sprint it doesn't mean whole
of the project will be at risk the
process of risk analysis continues to
take place with all the other processes
another significant reason for agile
project management is better and faster
return on investment the project is now
developed in several Sprints and each
Sprint has its own version therefore the
project becomes Market ready after a few
Sprints only since the projects can now
be released with ease and in shorter
duration this helps the organization to
stay ahead in competition with respect
to other organizations which have still
not moved to Agile methodology now we
shall check the principles of agile
project management there are 10
principles for successful agile project
management the first principle is the
satisfaction of the customer by
delivering the project fast and with
least number of Errors the next
principle refers to decreasing the
amount of time between the phase of
planning and delivery the third
principle states that the team of
managers and developers work together
and increase the productivity of their
work the next principle states that the
changes requested by the stakeholders
can be taken into consideration and
worked upon during the development phase
as well the fifth principal pays
attention to the factor of coordination
among the team members then the sixth
principle refers to the process of
monitoring and tracking the progress of
the project at the end of each Sprint
and making amendments wherever needed
moving on the next principle states that
there must be a feeling of trust and
support towards the team to complete the
Project's objectives the next principle
emphasizes on face-to-face conversations
with the development team the
face-to-face conversation helps in both
soling problems and easy knowledge
sharing then the ninth principle
emphasizes on finding Solutions and
maximizing the amount of work done with
Simplicity this ensures timely
completion of tasks by all the team
members the last principle states that
scrum tools like monday.com or Zoho
Sprints must be used to simplify the
complicated codes which further helps in
Saving Time We Shall now see the steps
in agile project management the goal of
agile methodology is to produce shorter
development life cyle cycles and more
frequent product releases than
traditional waterfall project management
so we will now check six steps in agile
project methodology the first step in
the process is Project planning project
planning includes feasibility study
development of scope breaking the
project into executable tasks or Sprints
and then estimating the amount of time
needed to complete those Sprints the
second step is the step of roadmap
creation a road map is a plan of action
that shows how a project shall evolve
over time a list of all the features
that the final product should have is
created and the steps to achieve those
features are taken the next important
step is release planning since we are
doing the project keeping in mind the
agile project methodology the project
will complete in Sprints that means
there will be the release of features at
the end of each cycle and unlike the
traditional waterfall model the
development Cycles will be smaller the
fourth step in agile project management
is Sprint planning the Sprints are made
keeping in mind what all is to be
accomplished in that particular Step At
the beginning of each Sprint the goal of
that Sprint is decided and steps to
achieve that goal are taken the next
step in the process emphasizes on daily
meetings there are short meetings every
day to discuss if the team was able to
finish the task for each Sprint and
check if there are any amendments that
are required each team member talks
about what they achieved in the last
Sprint and what are they going to work
on in the next Sprint the last step is
the step of Sprint review and
retrospective Ive there are two meetings
after each Sprint first meeting is for
the Sprint review this meeting is with
the stakeholders to show them the
finished product this helps both sides
to build a relationship and discuss if
there are any issues in the end product
the second meeting is for having a
Sprint retrospective this meeting
involves the stakeholders to discuss
what went well and what went wrong
during the Sprint Sprint retrospective
takes place after the Sprint review and
before the next Sprint planning now when
we know the steps needed for agile
project methodology we must understand
some agile project management Frameworks
there are several Frameworks available
today here we will be discussing some of
the most popular Frameworks the first
framework we will discuss is the canbin
framework canbin framework is a
wellknown framework for implementing
agile software development in the case
of canbin framework work items are
represented on the canbin board which
helps all the team members to see the
state of every piece of work at any time
canman board not only helps in
visualizing the work but also optimizing
the workflow among the team the next
framework we will discuss today is the
scrum framework scrum framework is a
popular framework for managing complex
knowledge work like in the field of
research and Advanced Technologies scrum
is a simple framework that helps team
work together and learn through their
experiences gained while working on a
problem the third framework we will see
today is the hybrid framework the hybrid
framework is a combination of agile
methodology and non-agile methodology in
the case of a hybrid framework planning
is done using the traditional way of
project management while the execution
and delivery is done using the agile
methodology since the hybrid is a
combination of the two it handles the
requirement changes and delivers the
product in different stages the fourth
and the last framework we will see is
the lean framework the lean framework
works on the principle of providing
maximum customer value and creating zero
wte it focuses on optimizing the flow of
products all through the value stream
this helps in eliminating waste all
through the process and create processes
that requires less human efforts this
also simplifies the process of
information management and makes it more
accurate finally let's have a look at
some companies that have opted for agile
project management today around 22% of
the organizations worldwide have all
their teams working on the principle of
agile project methodology did you know
know that IDC has confirmed 30 to 35% of
IT projects still fail the major reason
behind the failure of software
development projects is due to poor
communication poor management by senior
authorities employee resistance and
insufficient funding to avoid these
problems businesses prefer customer
Centric Innovation techniques such as
design thinking and agile
methodology these Concepts have similar
techniques such as Gathering user
feedback back following an iterative
approach of the model that results in a
better idea with such benefits designers
avoid errors and result in faster and
reliable output however these two
concepts are not interchangeable hi
welcome to Simply learns YouTube channel
today we'll be discussing the design
thinking and Agile development let us
see how these two techniques can be
implemented together now without further
Ado let's get started with the tutorial
design thinking and agile today we will
be looking at what is design thinking
what is agile design thinking explained
design thinking and agile so the first
topic what is design thinking design
thinking is extremely helpful in solving
problems that are IL defined or unknown
it is an iterative method that helps
resolve user issues or redefines
problems with the best Solutions
next let us understand what is agile
agile is a set of methods and practices
that focuses on iterative
development also requirements and
solutions are obtained due to
self-organizing cross functional teams
collaborating if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scaleup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more moving further
let us understand what is design
thinking in detail design thinking
requires designers to step into their
customer shoes and try to find a
solution to their problem with empathy
the process also helps resolve user
issues by redefining problems and
providing the best
Solutions design thinking covers five
stages they are empathy Define ideate
prototype and
testing let's talk about empathy first
the initial step to follow in the design
thinking process is to pay attention to
the client's requirements a designer or
its team should consider the user
requirements in short they should step
into their shoes and try to find the
solution to their problem in the best
way possible without the empathy stage
the design process lacks all important
user Centric quality which helps a
designer reach the success stage rather
than failing next comes the defined
stage the defined stage will encourage
the team to gather useful techniques in
order to solve challenges with the least
difficulty an individual will start to
progress to the third stage that is the
id8 stage by asking relevant questions
to encourage the person to develop ideas
and
solutions next is the id8 stage this
phase gives priority to creativity and
ideation in this stage the designers
will be performing ideation sessions and
searching for new ideas in simple words
the phase focuses on creative and
curious activity such as brainstorming
activity next is the Prototype stage in
this phase we can experiment and modify
the errors found in the product this
phas is a mini version of the product it
validates Solutions and tries to resolve
obstacles this stage has two prototypes
one is low Fidelity and the other one is
medium fidelity
finally comes testing this stage gives
importance to user feedback based on the
prototypes we have created basically in
this stage the user's feedback on the
Prototype stage is considered and
improvements are made that was all about
the five stages in design thinking
process moving forward let us see how
design thinking and agile can be
implemented
together while design thinking and agile
are applied separately the two
strategies can be implemented together
as well a majority of it companies have
begun to utilize agile in conjunction
with design thinking whereas agile
methodology is a practice of solving
problems and design thinking is an
approach to find user
problems for teams looking to leverage
agile and design thinking for the first
time here are a few recommendations to
focus on let us see the first topic
begin at a small level it means focus on
high value low risk opportunities in
order to earn better Solutions using
design thinking and agile together then
with better results take on more
challenging initiatives next is invest
in your research it means ensure the
entire design team understand the end
user Suppose there are any existing data
start by testing some ideas start the
design thinking process by building a
map of the user's Journey as a result it
encourages team members to focus on
empathize phase and discover new
Solutions next focus on a clearly
defined problem statement with Sprint
start design thinking in Sprint zero
encourage the entire team to understand
the problem statement and build a useful
design framework then build a production
team
culture form a core design and
development team teams such as decision
maker
ux researcher designer visual designer
scrum Master developers and quality
analysts do not exceed the team to more
than 10 members and make sure every
professional has an equal
say create an environment that supports
collaboration across departments like a
successful design solution next is
optimal use of design thinking use
design thinking during the first stage
of project development and then apply it
whenever an important feature has to be
developed next comes design patterns and
maintain a good user experience this
stage helps in minimizing design and
development time design patterns work as
building blocks encouraging team members
to remove lower level design decisions
the patterns created should be accepted
by the entire team and should be easily
implemented finally comes periodic Tes
testing based on the characteristics of
the project set up a testing schedule
the time can be scheduled once in 4 days
or once during the Sprint test simple
prototypes to eliminate errors and
understand the viability of ideas during
the early stages test the working
software and evaluate the result for a
better output so are you interested in
becoming an agile scrum professional
here we have certified scrum Master CSM
certification training course so hurry
up and enroll Now find the course Link
in the description box so this would
help the people who actually needs to
know something some important details
about agile and Associated details so
that can help them to understand the
agile and agile methodologies the tools
related to Agile better so explain agile
in brief if this is the question what
would be the typical answer so the term
agile refers to ability to move quickly
and easily
by becoming more flexible and
adaptable so most of the times I've have
seen people say whenever I ask the
question what is aile they say agile is
a methodology the term agile itself is
not a methodology it actually refers to
this flexibility adaptability so all
those methodologies which are there
defined for agile for example scrum so
they have an approach towards to become
agile and do the projects in agile way
so this requires adoption and adoption
of continual changing scenarios in
modern dynamic business environment
which means the flexibility and
adaptability is required because of the
changing business environment the
Dynamics to quickly adopt to the change
to become flexible agile approaches are
required it is very essential for
organization to become agile for their
sustenance and growth there are various
agile methods and practices that focuses
on iterative development typically any
agile methodologies follows iterative
approaches
requirements and solutions are obtained
through self-organizing cross functional
teams collaborating so collaboration is
very important any of the agel
methodologies we come across we speak
about cross functional self-organizing
teams so this is the basic details one
should know when they hear the term aile
so question number two explain the
difference between a traditional
waterfall model and agile testing so
when we say agile and waterfall it has
two different Dynamics all together so
agile model is a continuous iteration
life cycle model for developing and
testing software whereas waterfall is
linear sequential life cycle model for
developing and testing the
software so similarly the rigidity so
agile methodologies is flexible way of
building a software which provides lot
of flexibility Whenever there is a
change adopting to the change will
become very easy adapting and adopting
for the change scenario whereas in
waterfall methodology it is bit
difficult it is rigid because it's very
much structured any changes which comes
in adopting that and changing things to
according to the change Dynamics
requires changing many things which
makes it very tedious and rigid so
thirdly collaboration so agile model is
highly collaborative that's what it
approach considers mainly toward
software development where involvement
all the members involvement of all the
members like customers uh uh maybe the
team m MERS the project managers so
their active involvement is very much
required so that things can be handled
better so whereas waterfall model
generally don't insist on that so it is
least flexible and follow sequence of
steps which are predefined and that
doesn't allow the team to collaborate
even the collaboration happens it will
have a limitation because everything is
defined and one has to follow it and
comply to it there is no opportunity or
options to change anything so easily
when it comes to Waterfall model then
processes the entire process of
development is divided into iterations
which are of short period so that in
each of these iterations the working
model working piece of that product will
come out so in waterfall approach the
software development process is broken
down into several phases sequential
phases linear phases so things which has
to be delivered in each of the faes are
very well defined and accordingly it
happens so changes
changes may be made even after the
initial planning is completed in agile
approaches or in agile whenever whoever
follow agile it is easy to adopt to that
change scenario whereas in waterfall
approaches development requirements
cannot be changed once the project
development begins it will become
difficult because everything is defined
in a comprehensive way detailed so that
small changes may impact other parts of
the the products or descriptions which
is defined so software develop ment is a
collection of many different projects
which can happen in agile whereas
waterfall software development is
completed as a single project or
deliverable so testing testing is
performed in same iterations as
programming or building so within that
iteration since we build the working
product all the testing will be done
within that so that one would be fully
informed about that product which is
being developed in the iterations so
that users can give the feedback quickly
whereas testing phase is
separate in uh waterfall approaches but
however testing can be built in parallel
in waterfall also if it is planned that
way but still it does not give that
flexibility as it is there in the agile
because the product will not be
available to the users to give their
feedback so that necessary Corrections
cannot be made so whatever testing
reveals in waterfall methodologies the
corrections will be done by the team
limiting to their understanding whereas
in agile since users are very closely
involved working model is ready so the
feedback is straight from the users in
their perspective so that Corrections
can be made and ultimate product will be
very much useful to the people who are
going to use that product ultimately so
question number three what are some
important parts of agile
process so here are some of the
important principles that need to be
followed to make a process of agile so
one is customer satisfaction so very
much important one has to ensure
customer is satisfied customer sees the
product gives the feedback the uses it
gives the feedback necessary Corrections
are made in time so that quick delivery
of the product can be made according to
the requirement of the customers which
would result in high customer
satisfaction then changing needs so
agile welcome changes so any changing
needs will be addressed even late in the
development processes in the entire life
cycle of the project wherever the change
comes in taking that changes making that
necessary changes will be easy easier
when it comes to Agile delivery
frequently so ensuring software is
delivered frequently focusing on shorter
time scales which is very well uh
understood the full clarity of the
product and the working piece of the
product will come out of the iterations
so as I mentioned earlier as well quick
feedback from the users will also obtain
so that products which are delivered
will be as per the customer requirement
so agile approaches helps that way work
together so agile Manifesto emphasizes
on working together collaborations so
that each one of them contributes so
developers and business individuals has
to work together through the course of
the project so that necessary outcome
can be
created so motivated team so projects
need to be built around motivated
individuals and they must be trusted to
get the job done so as I mentioned in
the previous Point collaboration is very
important so we cannot ignore team as
well who is actually actively involved
in creation of those products so they
should be motivated and their active
involvement is very much required
face-to-face conversation is most
efficient means of communication so
since theel methodologies whatever is
defined actually emphasizes on having
the face Toof face conversation
collaborating better uh contributing
proactively and involvement proactivity
is very essential so conversation
communication plays a very important
role so working software working
software is a primary measure of
progress which will be delivered in each
of the iterations so that users can give
the necessary feedbacks so constant Pace
agile process promotes sustainable
development because all the products
which are being developed used feedback
obtained are in real time so people
actually know what is being produced and
what is that they can expect as it
progresses so Clarity is also one of the
things and that pace has to be
maintained and agile approaches helps to
accomplish it so good design agility can
be improved by focusing on technical
excellence and good design as you
progress as the changes comes in as you
adapt and adopt so since it has the
flexibility technically as well as
process wise as well as any of the
configuration wise it is easy to do the
necessary changes and have the design
which is required to accomplish the
ultimate results Simplicity the amount
of work that's not being done needs to
be minimized so we say Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication means what is
that required to be done consider only
that not anything else above or below
that so whatever we may require to do
focusing on that the minimum thing what
need to be done will be done and has to
be done when one follows AEL
approach self-organized the team is
self-organized so self organized teams
provides best architectures requirements
and design because they having various
different capabilities come together
contribute together with their
capability with a different capability
multi skilled as well will be present in
the self-organized team reflect and
adjust Effectiveness can be improved by
the team regularly reflecting on it
because as I mentioned earlier in every
iterations there are feedback obtained
testing is being done in each of the
iterations as it progresses so this will
help us in uh terms of providing the
Insight towards how is it progressing so
that that will help in quickly doing the
necessary Corrections which are required
to be done so next uh question number
four explain iterative and incremental
development in a j so incremental
development when we say the process is
divided into many small workable
increments so which can be done one
after the other each successive
increment Builds on the top of the work
done in the previous
increments over time functionalities are
added based on what was already created
so iterative development involves the
development of system by following
repeated Cycles or iterations based on
the results from the most recent
iterations of the process changes are
made this helps the project evolve over
time so the term evolve is the one which
one should keep in mind it is not that
I'm just going that is my destination
yes definitely that is a destination
while progressing there are lot of
variations which happens those
variations has to be considered and
accordingly the necessary deviations or
Corrections adjustments has to made and
things to be progressed further which is
very important because of this iterative
approach it helps to become adaptable
and flexible to adjust to these varying
conditions so that's where project
should evolve it cannot go in a straight
line it has to evolve based on the
variations while progressing towards the
destination or the results what we are
supposed to accomplish so agile
definitely iterative plus incremental so
agile involves consideration and
creation of working product in an
iterations which is part of the overall
final products the consolidation of all
the products which are produced in each
of the iterations will become part of
the ultimate results ultimate product
each iteration is an enhanced working
increment of the final product this
process continues until all the products
functionalities are satisfied
so organizations and user can use and
experience the product and provide
feedback that can be incorporated into
next iterations so each iterations when
the working product is produced those
things are used by the users
experience uh they will look at the
features and functionality and based on
the requirement what they're supposed to
fulfill they may also give the feedback
for necessary Corrections or they add
new requirement to it because the
minimum requirements what is being
fulfilled by this product
maybe some requirements which are not
expressed earlier there is an
opportunity to express at this point in
time to State we can involve some of the
features of these kind in the next
iteration so that we can able to make
this product better so such kind such a
conversation the incremental iterative
approach helps or allows or provides
that opportunity to express so causing
product road maps to be built produced
tested and confirmed before the next
iterations so that's where before move
to next iterations there will be better
Clarity in terms of what is produced
what we are supposed to produce further
and what is that modification we
supposed to do so that product can
ultimately fulfill the
requirements so question number five
what are the different types of agile
methodologies so there are various kinds
of agile methodologies some of them are
briefed here so let us go through them
one by one extreme programming so it is
a framework that any enables team to
create high quality software and
improves their quality of life it
enables software development with
appropriate engineering practices so
next is
Canan this method is used to design
manage and improve the flow of systems
organizations can visualize their flow
of work limiting their work in progress
so basically kban comes from the Toyota
system so here when we use the term
workflow the work in progress so this
will help in terms of monitoring what is
happening what work is in progress what
work is completed and it uses a visualiz
system so one can see it what is
happening so it also enables the
individuals who are doing it to know
what is that pending against them and
they can pick it up pull it up and then
complete it lean lean is a set of tools
and principles that aims to identify and
remove waste to increase the speed of
process development it focuses on
maximizing value of to the client
ensuring waste is minimized so lean uh
principles Le approaches says the flow
in a flow if there is any bottleneck
that needs to be removed so this
bottleneck would limit the flow and that
would add towards the waste so
identification of the waste the the
reason for the creation of the waste or
who is the contributor of the waste and
eliminate in those causes and moving
forward this will help in smoothening
the flow at the same time improving the
system for better outcome so that's
where Len is become popular and well
acknowledged so scrum is a framework
that is used by teams to establish a
hypothesis try out reflect on experience
and adjustments it is used to enable
teams to incorporate practices from
other Frameworks depending on the team's
requirement so that's about scrum scrum
is bit popular and it is mostly used for
smaller projects the bigger the project
more complex I think scrum would not
help but scrum is very popular uh in
software development organizations so
where uh it has a simple uh U five
events three roles and uh three
artifacts so it helps uh to adopt and uh
adapt to the changing conditions and it
has become a proven practice okay
crystal crystal is an approach to
software development that focuses on
people and their interactions rather
than tools and processes it is aimed to
streamline processes and improve
optimization it works on principle that
projects are unique and dynamic so next
question what are the principles of
agile testing so testing continuously to
ensure the product improves continuously
so as we know when we progress when we
adopt when we follow agile approaches
there is a reason because we need to
Able we should be able to respond to
that changes quickly we should be able
to understand what is going right what
is not quickly and do the necessary
correction then and there itself so
testing continuously become very
important because as we develop as we
test we can reveal any of the issues any
of the defects in the product what we
develop so that it reveals so obtain
feedback continuously to ensure the
product meets business requirements so
looking at the performance does this
features functionality of the product is
helpful to accomplish that business
requirement so this feedback comes from
the customers and users when we produce
at working piece of the uh product so
all team roles testing development Etc
need to be involved in testing process
so one cannot work in isolation there
should be very uh good collaboration
people from various different teams
working together complimenting to each
other very essential to become a jack so
the active involvement of business teams
and representatives can provide quick
feedback for each iterations so clean
and simplified code ensures it is defect
free during
iterations the documentation created
must be limited into a particular
iterations so when we speak about
waterfall approach the documentation
will be very comprehensive for the
entire project but the moment we speak
about agile the documentation will get
limited to what is being produced in the
iterations which is very important so
what is being produced in iterations and
that is based on the actually what is
produced something I planned in for the
iterations some changes happen we
developed it created it there is a
feedback which is coming up
documentation is limited to that so
Corrections which can be made to the
documentation will be easier and quicker
so along with development and
implementation testing is done to ensure
the product is defect free continuous
involvement of users ensures the final
product matches their requirement which
is Ultimate need so question number
seven what are some agile metrics that
need to be focused
on so some of the popular metrics which
are used are measuring burndown of
deliverables which is usually
represented using burndown charts
similarly we have burnup chart also
where uh as we complete the task the
highight of the bar keeps increasing in
burnup charts but most popular is burn
down so that what is to be delivered
will be easily visible so the velocity
lead time cycle time code
quality code covered in unit
test deployment success rate net promote
score so these are the basic metrics
which are really needed when we are
speaking about the velocity and speed at
the same time how quickly we are able to
produce what is supposed to to be done
and planned are we going accordingly or
not so this will help in terms of uh
making our job as for the need so
metrics has to be selected very
carefully so metric is not just a number
it should have an interpretation and
that interpretation should actually
complement to the business needs and
requirements so metric should have an
clear description of what is this
measurement is all about and what is
that we're going to understand from that
measuring that Matrix so next is what is
Canan so Canan system is visual system
which helps better management of work as
work moves through processes so it is it
visualizes and provides visibility into
the process workflows and works passing
through the processes So when you say is
a v it is a visual system so there will
be board or a display system where each
of the tasks which needs to be
accomplished are displayed there and the
person who is who was supposed to
complete it and what is the status of it
so people would look at it pull the work
and complete it so since people pull
that work it is also called as pull
system so because the new works are
pulled in taken up from the list for
execution and move them from in progress
status to done so kban since it is a
visual system it also makes people more
conscious about what is spending against
them what work is pulled that is also
visible so there there is no reason for
anyone to say that I did not do this
because of XYZ reasons since it is
visible it is my job since I pull that
task it is my job my ownership to
completed it becomes like that so that
discipline comes into place so tracking
the work will also become easier as the
workflow is clearly visible and put on
the display board modern organization
can also use the digital display systems
we're seeing this more adoption in uh
many many organizations today because it
the value of using it the contribution
of of it is seen by organization and can
on playing it roles in the organization
and it's very essential to have this
practice so the goal is identification
of constraints that is potential
bottleneck in the process and ensure
they are addressed this ensures that the
workflow becomes smoother and more
efficient I think I mentioned the
reasons question number nine what are
some popular agile tools so some of the
tools which we keep hearing uh today
when whenever uh people say we do Agile
is uh some of these are listed here like
JB jira software Trello Zoho yic
verizone one and many more I think uh
before we choose a tool it is very
important for anyone to understand what
is that they require first and what tool
can help them in terms of accomplishing
it so it requires a lot of uh uh
analysis uh assessment on the tools and
the comparison with what is being done
in the the organization and how this
tool would suit that organization's
requirement is very essential so tool is
not first the requirements the need
analysis and then what tools best suit
the environment that is the step only
then selecting the tool makes sense
however studying the tools and comparing
the tools and the features functionality
will also help defining uh what needs to
be there in place in the organization
when they become agile or adopt and of
certain practices what are the obstacles
to the agile
process so some of the obstacles that
one could phase are not having the
appropriate or sufficient tools and
Technologies so it is quite obvious
organization struggle not having the
right tools and Technologies as I
mentioned earlier it is very important
to understand what is our need first and
what tools suits best at the same time I
also mentioned study the tools and
Technologies and what do do they offer
and what do we have do we really need
that additional things the Gap whatever
we find do we really need those in our
environment is that Dynamics is there in
our environment that needs to be
understood the lack of active
involvement from the customer so when we
say agile involvement of all the
stakeholders are very very important
because the changing needs comes from
users and customers whenever the
iteration is complete working piece is
delivered if customer doesn't respond or
explain or provide the feedback
then moving towards the next iterations
will become difficult it is very
essential the active involvement of the
stakeholders and very important
stakeholders is users and
customers the team members lacking in
skills and capability so one has to
ensure the team members are groomed with
the right capability and that should be
evaluated on a continual basis so that
organization can handle things in an
agile way and contribute towards the
projects what is being done and become
agile
some of the obstacles further if you can
look at is the inability to design
system based on unseen requirements so
this unseen requirement is very Dynamic
so when they will crop up we will not
know but however the systems what we
designed should able to provide that uh
opportunity whenever such variations
happens you can able to easily adopt or
invol or take that particular new
requirement and plug in so otherwise one
cannot become so rigid there should be
flexibility adapting the agile culture
to the organization so culture plays an
very important role so a lot of
resistance would come across to adopt
the new way of doing things people may
not appreciate uh the agile way of doing
things so it requires a lot of uh effort
motivation and uh making people to
understand why the organization has
taken up uh the task to make it agile
and building a culture where people
would think in agile way and contribute
to the organization question number 11
differentiate between agile and scrum so
the term agile as I mentioned earlier
refers to ability to move quickly and
easily by becoming more flexible and
adoptable whereas scrum is an agile
methodology which enables organization
so organization can become agile so
agile Manifesto and 12 principles acts
as guidelines to become agile whereas uh
scrum is used in the projects where
requirements are constantly changing
aligning to Agile Manifesto and 12
principles they should follow what is
told in Manifesto and principles so
agile Manifesto mentions about the
required collaboration interactions to
become aile whereas scrum defines the
roles the scrum Master the product owner
and cross functional self-organizing
teams who are involved in making the
project delivering the project project
in agile way so agile manifest also
mentions about the required focus on
working software and focus on change
whereas scrum approach enables teams to
react to changes quickly so means how to
become flexible what is that we need to
consider to become flexible is defined
in Manifesto means stressed on it
whereas scrum follows with that approach
one can become easily flexible so
delivery the Manifesto provides
necessary guidelines on frequent
delivery of software so where scrum with
the Sprints it build builds are
delivered to users regularly and upheld
agile principles so collaboration agile
Manifesto stresses upon individuals
interactions and customer collaboration
so scrum does it through various events
like daily standup meeting and other
scrum events like Sprint meeting Sprint
retrospective whereas people sitting and
discussing about writing and user story
The epics or selecting the product uh
from the product backlog to the Sprint
backlog so various events which happens
in scrum demonstrating that uh uh point
which is stressed in agile Manifesto
about individuals interactions and
customer collaboration are demonstrated
with various different events in scrum
methodology so next question what are
some popular agile
certifications so some of the popular
agel certifications are PMI ACP
certification which is offered by by PMI
us scrum Master
certification then certified scrum
Master Prince to Agile
certification then scrum product owner
certification so next we will move to
scenario based questions so before we uh
go and answer the scenario based
questions let us look at the scenario
what the scenario says the manager X was
having the discussion with the team
about the upcoming event the event was
scheduled to conduct an online marketing
campaign to increase the sales due to
increased competition and rapidly
changing customer
behaviors the campaign is very crucial
and organization has decided to do it
more
often this is done through the online
platform the organization has the
requirement of integration with
organization's website with all the
features and
functionalities the various roles
involved in the marketing campaign are
marketing manager Market team campaign
coordinators creators of content and
browers for campaign and the
participants of the campaign all of
these roles should have access to
platform through registration so that
they can have the required access and
make the marketing campaign successful
besides marketing manager has sto the
reports needs to be generated which
depicts the number of campaigns
conducted responses registrations
conversations Etc so this scenario
speaking about uh the marketing uh
challenges or problems what organization
has and through that problem statement
they wanted to ensure to the marketing
campaign and also they want to have an
online platform uh to to make this
marketing campaign successful and also
speaks about the various different roles
involved in this so let us look at what
are the typical questions which would
come across in such
scenarios so first question says can you
write a user story from the perspective
of marketing manager and participant so
firstly we need to understand what is
this user story is All About so in the
perspective of marketing manager is
something anyway we will look at it what
it is but user story is the one which
depicts the
requirements assuming the role as a
specific role I need to do this I want
to have this it it gives that an
explanation so that one can easily
understand about that requirement what
need of consumer consumers or what need
of business this particular features
functionality is going to fulfill so let
us see what is that user story uh
relating to marketing manager and uh
participants so yes why not here are few
examples marketing manager us a story
says as a marketing manager I need to
assign the activities task to the team
members so now whenever we develop that
platform there should be access to
marketing manager and marketing manager
can able to assign the activities to the
team members so what feature that
particular platform should have has to
be defined and designed accordingly and
this is the requirement participant
perspective as a participant I need to
register for the campaign so now there
should be registration page obviously
and then whatever the process needs to
be follow to create that registration
for the participant that needs to be
made and this simple user story helps
into visualize what features
functionality has to be there when we go
on and create that product and
services so this will help understanding
the requirement thoroughly and creating
the designing the features accordingly
and visualizing the flow as well so next
question is agile the best approach to
make a marketing campaign and why so now
question arises should when we do
marketing campaign why should I follow
aile why not I do just like that why do
we need agile what is that essential
need because already I mentioned the
need of agility requires I mean whenever
there is an adaptability whenever
there's dynamics of changes whenever I
want to become uh someone who can able
to become competitive because
competition is also responding to the
Dynamics of the market quickly I should
be there in the business so obviously uh
does uh this question make sense can
this marketing campaign can be done in
the agile way so obviously yes because
the agile approach is the best way to go
with for marketing campaign reason being
the rapidly changing behaviors of the
consumers which has to be understood and
detail should be put in their
perspective and accordingly the features
has to be provided so always in the
consumer perspective customer
perspective secondly with increased
competition the organization has to
consider the unique differentiator to
sustain and grow there should be
uniqueness that needs to be understood
and that requires exercising
continuously and uh creating the
products accordingly so this marketing
campaign would help to understand that
so next question what are the typical
product backlog items so for this what
could be the typical backlog items means
the list of user stories list of epics
which can help in terms of defining the
features and
functionality the typical backlog items
may include the features like
registration page login page campaign
contains platform to conduct campaign
assess requirements so so likewise we
can keep writing so user stories helps
us to list what is that we may require
to develop in this product so this
requires a lot of collaboration and
discussion only then I think uh that
will become more visible next question
is what are the some considerations made
while selecting the items for product
backlog while selecting the backlog item
to each iterations from the product
backlog the backlog item has to be
prioritized definition of done for those
items to be selected value delivered
Improvement considerations Etc has to be
made so prioritization is very very
important what features functionality I
should develop first and how it makes
sense to my business how users will be
helped how customer will get benefited
so these will help in terms of having
those features functionality developed
in such an order where for that moment
that features and functionality are
available we're not just jumping into
everything and doing it one by one in a
order in a prioritize list
so it is very essential to prioritize
defining uh the definition of done and
selecting the items accordingly and then
what value it delivers understanding
that and improving next question is the
involvement of marketing manager
required during the project and why it's
quite obvious marketing manager
involvement is very essential because it
is a marketing campaign yes the
involvement of marketing manager is very
important and crucial and it is a role
who will have the full visibility into
the requirements to be fulfilled and on
ground realities besides one cannot
become agile without the active
involvement and collaboration of
customer users with agile teams before
