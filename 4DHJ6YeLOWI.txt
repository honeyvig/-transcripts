00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,900
hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,660
tutorial my name is tan May bakshi and

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,920
this time we're going to be going over

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,160
using the Nuance speech kit in Swift

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,140
with iOS

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,180
well to begin this was actually a

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,680
question sent to me by one of my

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,220
subscribers

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,740
on clip now this is tarabala Christian

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,900
one of my subscribers

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,260
days ago she on a YouTube comment uh on

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,120
my NS speech recognizer tutorial

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,340
actually asked me how we can actually

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,360
use the Nuance speech SDK for iOS with

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,520
swift so that's the tutorial I'm

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
creating today I hope this helps you out

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,620
Tara

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,559
season sent by Tara uh let's actually

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,660
get into the Mac part

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,239
I will be explaining exactly how we can

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,899
use the Nuance speech kit with swift too

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,600
so uh let's get right into it shall we

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,119
so welcome back to the Mac part and now

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm going to be showing you uh well I

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,439
mean just before this super simple and

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,240
short code I'm going to show showing you

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
a demo of the app that I've made for

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,340
Tara so let's begin as you can see this

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,619
is my iPhone mirrored onto my Mac

31
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,659
alright so as you can see what I'm gonna

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,840
do is I am going to say a sentence into

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,759
this application and let's see if it can

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,680
convert it to text so as you can see

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,720
there is a listen button right over at

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,340
the bottom here so we're going to click

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,560
this this will turn into listening then

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,500
the label over here will uh tell us what

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,360
the result is uh right as we're done

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,220
saying things now this will

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,200
automatically detect when you are done

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,000
talking and so you don't need to click

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,860
any sort of stop button which is just

44
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,500
great again Siri is actually powered by

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,960
Nuance and so that's actually a really

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,299
neat fun fact But continuing though

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,240
let's uh begin so let's actually give it

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,060
something pretty simple like

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,640
I have a YouTube channel comma in which

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,259
I like to teach things period

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,360
as you can see it says I have a YouTube

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,220
channel in which I like to teach things

53
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,020
alright so that was pretty simple let's

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,940
try something else though as you can see

55
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,080
I'm going to click on listen and it

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,840
turns into listening

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,080
I have created this sample app for one

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
of my subscribers

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,160
as you can see it said I have created

60
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,480
this sample app for one of my

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,760
subscribers great as you can see Nuance

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,440
is actually pretty accurate now there's

63
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,660
one thing that I am going to save for

64
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,819
the last which is actually just

65
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,860
fascinating uh but then again the best

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,200
examples are going to be saved for the

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,239
last uh all right so now let's continue

68
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,640
though let's begin with the UI shall we

69
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,440
so as you can see the UI is even simpler

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,780
than the code the listen button has an

71
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,660
IB action on the touch up inside which

72
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,700
has button clicked can't get simpler

73
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,379
than that button click gets executed

74
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,260
right as you click a button done okay

75
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,819
referencing Outlets we have an IB Outlet

76
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,459
that's called a record button connected

77
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,099
to the button that's it all right but

78
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,080
the label is a bit different the label

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,640
is actually connected only to an IB

80
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,940
Outlet that's called result label okay

81
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,159
that's the label now as you can see in

82
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,379
the code we actually have those two IB

83
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,959
Outlets uh record button which is a UI

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,819
button and result label which is a UI

85
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,920
label now as you can see view controller

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
doesn't just in uh actually let me see

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,140
UI view controller uh is a class so it

88
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,180
doesn't just inherit from UI view

89
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,879
controller but it actually conforms to

90
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,480
the SK transaction delegate protocol and

91
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,099
in case you were wondering actually if

92
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,959
you were to click on command on your

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,000
keyboard actually I promise I'm clicking

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,799
command on my keyboard and if you move

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,000
around your mouse you can actually see

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,459
these things convert into links whenever

97
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,620
you hover over something and so

98
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,019
basically if I hover over SK transaction

99
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,239
delegate and I click on it and then I

100
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,940
release command and the click as you can

101
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,739
see basically it shows us where this is

102
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,780
defined and as you can see right now

103
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,140
this is actually a public protocol of SK

104
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,239
transaction delegate in the nuanced

105
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,299
speech kit framework and so that's why I

106
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,040
know that this is a protocol so I can

107
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,720
say that this can then new controller

108
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,820
conforms to it not in the hair it's from

109
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,739
if it were to inherit from that would be

110
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,320
a class conforms to linear protocol all

111
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,300
right so I'm going to explain exactly

112
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,919
what the difference is in just a second

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,479
but then again that's an entirely

114
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,600
separate video uh but I will explain in

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
minor detail right now in just a second

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,639
then let's look at the IB action

117
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,740
function called button clicked now what

118
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,360
does this do basically we're going to

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
take the record button and we're going

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
to set its title to listening and for

121
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,120
State normal you don't need to worry

122
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,440
about that this that's just telling

123
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,940
record button that it's still a normal

124
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,220
button it's it's not weird

125
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,000
um

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,419
so basically uh the record buttons title

127
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,040
is now listening instead of listen

128
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,320
because you've clicked on it but then

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
after that we actually create a session

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
which is equal to a new speech kit

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,199
session or SK session for short if we go

132
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,040
into this this is inside of speech kit

133
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,380
and so basically what we're doing here

134
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,180
is we're creating that SK session with a

135
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,419
URL now basically the hard part is comes

136
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,979
in you want you're going to want to

137
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,360
actually go to the link in the

138
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,160
description uh the link in the

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,199
description basically brings you to a

140
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,139
page in Nuance that allows you to

141
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,979
actually register for an API key and so

142
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,259
once you've done that uh you will

143
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,880
actually get something called a Sandbox

144
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,940
credential now basically this is a

145
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,120
development credential uh and when

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,860
you're sort of developing your app with

147
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,080
Nuance you want to use these credentials

148
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,580
because they're absolutely free and who

149
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,400
doesn't like free stuff however what

150
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,139
this is not fit for production use okay

151
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,820
you want something that's paid when you

152
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,100
actually actually use it for a sort of

153
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,500
real life when it's on the App Store

154
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,740
basically and so basically uh you're

155
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,419
just going to want to pay when you're

156
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,120
actually uh using it for production but

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,440
right now when you're developing it I

158
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,360
guess uh the free credentials work

159
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,740
perfectly fine and they're called

160
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,139
sandbox credentials uh so basically what

161
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,639
you're going to want to do is take those

162
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,220
sandbox credentials and I mean I'm using

163
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,660
speech kit too but you could also use

164
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,340
speech kit one but I don't see why you

165
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,020
would do that since they have newer

166
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,240
versions released now and so basically

167
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,500
what you're going to do is you're going

168
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,160
to take the link that you get on these

169
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,600
speech kit too

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,199
um

171
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,720
under speaker two you'll see a link and

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,100
you're going to take that link and it'll

173
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,900
look something like this except instead

174
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,479
of tagumanny gmail.com it'll be your own

175
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,580
email and then lots of other random

176
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,199
letters along with the date that you

177
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,600
registered I assume this is I Don't Know

178
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,940
But continuing though it'll just give

179
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,039
you a link and you want to copy that and

180
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,620
paste it into this string okay I have

181
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,419
already done that then it's also going

182
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,160
to give you an application token near

183
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,220
the end uh but before speech kit one and

184
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,960
you're going to want to copy that into

185
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,360
here as well once you're done you're

186
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,160
going to actually type in another line

187
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,380
of code and this will essentially tell

188
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,600
the session that's uh and so the session

189
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,639
is basically connecting to the Nuance

190
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,979
SDK in the cloud and so basically what

191
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,060
you're going to do is you're going to

192
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,800
say you know what start listening

193
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,139
through the microphone for some sort of

194
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,780
uh user voice and so basically we're

195
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,300
going to say session dot recognize with

196
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,120
type SK transaction speech type

197
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,639
dictation what does this mean what do

198
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,680
these Ren letters mean they basically

199
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,720
just mean that Nuance will listen for

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
users voice and convert it into uh text

201
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,020
it'll dictate it okay

202
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,720
or the user will dictate to it basically

203
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,460
okay so that's what that is you don't

204
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,960
really need to worry about that too much

205
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,340
I don't know why they haven't created

206
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,380
enumeration for this but they haven't

207
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,120
for some reason now they could have done

208
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,180
SK transaction.speech type dot or speech

209
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,099
type dot dictation sorry uh which would

210
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,539
have been a bit cleaner way of doing it

211
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,300
but whatever uh continuing though then

212
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,099
we set the detection to long now this

213
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,560
can also be short or none uh and so

214
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,660
basically long means that the user will

215
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,000
be able to literally say in paragraphs

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,740
with punctuation and stuff but you could

217
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,360
also set this to short and that would be

218
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,160
like a sentence for like a quick text

219
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,080
message and you could even set this To

220
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,300
None now the reason I'm not doing none

221
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,099
is because that would require an

222
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,960
entirely separate function from that

223
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,240
delicate that were or that delegate that

224
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,039
we are conforming to SK transaction

225
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,800
delegate and so basically we would have

226
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,599
to sort of say when the user would click

227
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,599
a stop button uh in order for nuance to

228
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,479
actually stop listening for the user's

229
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,180
voice and but with detection it'll

230
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,339
automatically realize when the user is

231
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,500
done saying stuff and will automatically

232
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,779
just sort of stop listening and sort of

233
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,660
tell us the answer so that's why I use

234
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,120
detection and so that's why I also like

235
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,920
to keep it on long because with long you

236
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,720
can really say short stuff as well it

237
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,580
just isn't as good at it but with short

238
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,500
you can't really say it as long of

239
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,120
things so I'm just going to keep it that

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,680
long you can always change this if you'd

241
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,720
like and if you need help with the dot

242
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,700
none option please do tell me I will

243
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,620
have my contact info at the end of the

244
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,779
video but continuing dog

245
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,580
and then we set the language to English

246
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,740
USA now again you can use whatever

247
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,620
language you have I assume there is a

248
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,360
link in the documentation for the

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,660
nuanced speech kit SDK and so basically

250
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,279
they would describe sort of the

251
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,019
languages that are actually compatible

252
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,019
with nuance and so if they do have a

253
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,880
page like that if I'm able to find it it

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,220
will be in the description I hope I find

255
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,860
it for you that's uh basically then

256
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,680
we've set the delicate uh the delegate I

257
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,779
don't know why it's in delicate delegate

258
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,360
uh then we set the delegates of that

259
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,519
session to sell because we are

260
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
conforming to that protocol and that

261
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,480
there has to be a reason for it and so

262
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,980
this is why we're actually doing that

263
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,200
all right so that's why yeah that's

264
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,279
basically what we're gonna do there

265
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,140
however

266
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,200
what happens when Nuance is done sort of

267
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,540
getting the answer for us well that's

268
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,420
where the next function comes in now

269
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,300
to a protocol the protocol will give us

270
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,220
optional functions that we can or

271
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,140
mandatory functions that we can include

272
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,839
into our code in order to add some

273
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,240
functionality for example this sessions

274
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
delegate has been set to sell and so now

275
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,399
what it's going to do is since we

276
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,279
conform to this delegate and we're

277
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,260
setting ourselves to that sort of a

278
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,180
delegate of the session

279
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,580
it'll know that when we're done we have

280
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,100
to contact view controller

281
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,620
transaction function now there are many

282
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,160
transaction functions in this protocol

283
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,899
however one of them which is uh quite

284
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,640
interesting called didn't receive

285
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,100
recognition this one will actually be

286
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,120
called when the Nuance SDK is done sort

287
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,160
of recognizing what the user said in

288
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,320
transcribing it and so basically what we

289
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,660
do here is we actually get an SK

290
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,079
recognition from the nuance svk

291
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,420
after that what we want to do is we want

292
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,459
to take the highest scoring candidate

293
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,779
from that entire list of uh sort of

294
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,940
candidate answers of what uh the what

295
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,100
the user could have said we want to take

296
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,019
the highest scoring candidate and we

297
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,399
want to put that into a string okay

298
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,959
we're going to put that into one string

299
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,320
and put that into the result labels text

300
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,600
um we're going to set that as the text

301
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,240
of result label which is our UI label

302
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,880
that we uh declared up here all right so

303
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,500
once we've done that we've already given

304
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
our user uh the answer for them then

305
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,820
what we're going to do is we're going to

306
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,220
set the record buttons title back to

307
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,079
listen because we're done listening now

308
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
we're not listening to the user anymore

309
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,740
and so we're going to set the button

310
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,720
back to listen

311
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,060
that's it all right so that was pretty

312
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,279
much uh all we had to uh describe for

313
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,740
the code but now as I said I'd like to

314
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,120
show you one more thing which is

315
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,000
actually absolutely fascinating if I

316
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,880
were to actually say to this app

317
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,800
okay I have to get ready this is a lot

318
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,420
of stuff to say all right

319
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,459
this app is running on an iPhone comma

320
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,240
which runs iOS comma however comma my

321
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,540
Mac comma which is an iMac comma runs

322
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,640
Mac OS X comma which runs xcode comma

323
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,640
okay great so as you can see uh what has

324
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,320
happened is it says transcribe the

325
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,019
entire thing uh into this app is running

326
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,480
on the iPhone which runs iOS however my

327
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Mac which is an iMac runs Mac Oh Mac OS

328
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,540
X Mac OS X which runs xcode now this

329
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,300
usually works if I were to say

330
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,300
Mac OS X runs on my iMac

331
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,880
and for some reason it gives us m-a-c-k

332
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,800
don't know why it was working a few

333
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,680
minutes ago anyway uh so I mean that's a

334
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,500
problem with the Nuance SDK not with our

335
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,200
code so I mean that would be fixed soon

336
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I guess it keeps changing I guess I mean

337
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,820
it's machine learning so it would have

338
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,639
kept learning from people's uh responses

339
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,800
to the SDK but then again whatever

340
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,620
continuing that's gonna be it for this

341
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,360
tutorial I really hope this uh you
