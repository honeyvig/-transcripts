foreign
applications traditional react
applications are used to render on the
client side now we'll discuss about the
next days a flexible react framework
called nexjs gives you the tool you need
to build fast web applications so one
question is coming into your mind I know
which is why do we actually mean by this
let's spend some time defining react and
next.js And discussing how they may be
useful but before that if you want to
become a software developer consider our
course phone full stack developer mean
stack by simply learn and master those
necessary skills
check out the link in the description
for more details
so hello everyone and welcome back to
another video by simply learn
this is another verb and in this video
we are going to talk about next.js but
before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and
press the Bell icon so you will get all
the updates from simplino
so without further Ado let's begin and
see what's in it for you first let's
discuss the components of web
application you must need to consider
some things before creating not just
react but any modern applications
like let's see
first one is user interface the user
interface should be smooth and
interactive when creating any web
application
the next one is routing
how users navigate from one part of the
application to another is known as
routing
the next one is data fetching fetching
data from a source like where your data
lives and how to get it used is data
fetching now we'll talk about rendering
rendering when and where static or
dynamic material is rendered
Integrations
what third-party services use like CMS
Earth payments Etc and how to connect
with them
infrastructure when you deploy store and
run your application code serverlessly
CDN as Etc performance
how to optimize your application from
end users is known as performance
scalability how your application adopts
as a team data and traffic growth is
known as scalability
developer experience your team's
experience building and maintaining your
applications are known as developer
experience now let's talk about react
so
what is react.js react is a JavaScript
library which is used to build fast and
interactive mobile and web applications
it is an open source reusable component
based front-end library of JavaScript
react is a combination of HTML and
JavaScript
it provides a reversed and opinionated
way to build modern application
interface
so the component that user views and
interact with on a screen are referred
to as a user interface
react is a library that offers helpful
UI capabilities
still it is up to the developers to use
those functions in their application
on the other hand it takes work to
create a whole react application from
scratch
for typical application requirement
developers will spend time to
configuring tools and developing few
Solutions after much anticipation
developers created a framework of react
which is the next JS now let's discuss
what is next.js
next.js is an open source web
development framework created by virtual
enabling react-based web application
with server-side rendering engine rating
static websites
in addition next.js offer additional
structures features and optimizations
for your application next is take care
of the tooling and settings required for
react.js
so one question must be coming into your
mind again which is why next.js why
should we use next Js
so
the reason to choose next.js is its SEO
efficiency which is search engine
optimization
next is the next is next is using server
side rendering and the same time next.js
can be great static site generator
now let me give you an example of SEO so
if you have created a website and you
want whenever anyone searches for the
website name your website name should
come on the top so for that you need to
do search engine optimization and with
that your website will get more traffic
means more people will see your website
now let's move on to the advantages
so advantages includes excellent user
experience
simpler and quicker
wonderful performance also easier and
faster
the rapid growth of features these are
some advantages of next.js the biggest
and well-known businesses in the world
like Netflix Uber Starbucks are
frequently used net.js it is also
regarded as one of the react framework
with the fastest growth making it ideal
to use for the static web pages
till now as we all know that next days
focuses on the user interface and user
experience
let me give you an example again
if you are running a business and the ux
of the web application is not good it
leads to losing customers
the layout is also very important
because if you use themes or template
there is a chance that similar looking
design are used by someone else
additionally it implies that you can't
create a special customer experience
fortunately you can create a complete
unique user experience using next.js
let's see the benefits of using next
jails for the business which is better
SEO will lead to better traffic and
sales similarly good ux will also help
the business in sales
now let's see the disadvantages of next
is
the first one on our list is cost of
flexibility since next.js does not offer
many pre-built font Pages you must build
the entire front-end layer from scratch
the next one is development and
management
if you want to use next.js to create any
online store but don't have a team of
developer on staff you will need someone
to take care of the development and
management thereafter
next one is integrated State manager the
lack of an integrated State manager
means that you must use Redux mobax or a
similar tool if you need a state manager
the next is
low number of plugins
compared to
getsbial.js less easily adaptable
plugins can be used finally I will say
next.js is great when you want to have a
static website with many updates so with
this we have read the end of this video
on what is next.js
