1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,850
Alexa ask answer bot question who played

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,860
against IBM Watson in jeopardy let me

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,490
think about that

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,010
Alexa ask answer bought I think pensions

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,099
is correct for 35.7% confidence Alexa

6
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:29,279
ask answer bot question which company

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,840
manufactures Gorilla Glass let me think

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,899
about that

9
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:42,540
Alexa ask answer bot I think Courtney is

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,700
correct with 100 point 0 percent

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,010
confidence now

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,660
Alexa ask answer bot question which

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,960
worldwide retail chain makes the most

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,500
profit let me think about that

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,990
Alexa ask answer but I think Walmart is

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,580
correct with forty eight point seven

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,460
eight seven percent confidence let's get

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,479
into the video now

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,510
so hello there and welcome to another

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,420
tutorial my name is Tammy Bakshi and

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,550
this time we're gonna be going over how

22
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,400
you can use the Alexa skills kit with

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,369
the Lausanne - IOT platform and IBM

24
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:39,590
Watson in this case my Aston application

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,060
which we'll be getting into in just a

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,220
little bit in order to create an

27
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,369
intelligent Alexa application or vast

28
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,130
skill that can answer your natural

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,200
language questions getting a little bit

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,820
deeper into it let's start off with the

31
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,070
part I'm sure you're most interested in

32
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,280
and that is the Alexa yes that's right

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,619
in fact just last week I was in Las

34
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,690
Vegas and I was there for you know for

35
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,790
miles so systems for MIPS conference

36
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,410
while I was there and now we're actually

37
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,410
getting participants as a welcome gift I

38
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,290
was on echo dot and so I got a few as

39
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,360
well now I'm ready and I thought you

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,150
know why not create a YouTube video and

41
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,550
how the Alexa skills kit actually works

42
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,890
and how you can use it to develop skills

43
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,440
for your own Alexa device and then of

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,150
course publish it to their sort of app

45
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,890
stores skills storing as you could call

46
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,130
it for other people to use as well and

47
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,410
so I thought why not why create a

48
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,290
regular skill when I can combine a lot

49
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,299
of the other technologies that I use in

50
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,459
order to create an even better and even

51
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,430
more useful Alexa skill in fact today

52
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,380
I'm actually taking one of my very first

53
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,600
IBM Watson applications one that's not

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,880
only maintained but developed actively

55
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,310
and is in fact open source online github

56
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,510
page called

57
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,390
asked ma asked Anna is an LQA or a

58
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,040
natural language question answering

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,350
system that can answer your natural

60
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,880
language questions that have a person

61
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,700
organization or a location answer type

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,489
it uses the power of Ivan Watson natural

63
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,739
language classifier and natural language

64
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,410
understanding in its back-end as well as

65
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,600
bi-directional attention to flow by

66
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,370
Allen AI Institute

67
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,110
alright now let's get a little bit

68
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,630
deeper into how the actual Alexa skill

69
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,570
works and how this new topic of the

70
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,880
Lausanne to IOT platform actually ties

71
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,950
in with it let's take a look all right

72
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,019
now getting a little bit deeper into it

73
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,480
let's start off with taking a look at

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,299
the flow of the application now of

75
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,510
course we have the Alexa itself in this

76
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,630
case I've got a doc device but any Alexa

77
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,880
will work you could even use a simulator

78
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,880
online you could use Amazon's official

79
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,549
Alexa simulator all these devices will

80
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,310
work perfectly for this now once you've

81
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,169
gotten your Alexa device up and running

82
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,299
and you're ready to start off what you

83
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,010
need to do is sign up for a platform

84
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,100
called a losan to IOT platform now when

85
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,019
you're designing an Alexa app you have

86
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,290
to but you have to wait two methods to

87
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,989
go down two rows to go down either you

88
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,910
can use AWS lambda which is what's

89
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,130
recommended by Amazon and if you use

90
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,290
lambda which is Amazon server less

91
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,389
compute platform then what happens is

92
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,820
you're going to be using this and of

93
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,310
course I was on Web Services I'm just in

94
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,960
case you are wondering Amazon all-access

95
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,120
skills kit is not part of the Amazon Web

96
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,550
Services they are entirely separate

97
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,410
they're part of the Amazon developer

98
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,070
console suite and so in this case though

99
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,510
I didn't want how to take you into the

100
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,430
world mammals on Web Services just yet

101
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,949
let's kiss today let's actually try and

102
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,600
develop something with a REST API to

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,290
keep it local on our own server and so

104
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,320
what I've done is actually I guess you

105
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
could say a different way of creating an

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,360
Alexa skill and the lausanne to iot

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,000
platform is a very easy way of doing

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,010
this because what happens is through the

109
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,010
lausanne at the Lausanne DMT platform I

110
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,500
don't need to do any manual

111
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,880
authorization or the SSL Certificates or

112
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,580
anything else that Amazon requires you

113
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,949
to do when you're working with this

114
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,060
technology and so using Lausanne

115
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,120
I actually opened up an HTTP endpoint

116
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,630
and this HTTP endpoint can be contacted

117
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,580
via Alexa we'll talk about that in just

118
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,280
a moment now once we've gotten that

119
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,340
Lausanne to IOT platform up and right

120
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,350
to take a look at what exactly those

121
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,990
avila Laur alexa to communicate with in

122
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,030
this case we're actually communicating

123
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,960
with of course ask Tanmay which is my

124
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,199
cognitive application built using IBM

125
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,120
Watson we'll get to that in just a

126
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,490
little bit actually

127
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,650
there's an entire suite of applications

128
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,900
that we're going to be using and they're

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,070
built in Python

130
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,740
so let's observe this section for Python

131
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,290
now we've also got a flask so this is

132
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,419
actually building these flask API this

133
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:19,200
is a flask HTTP server again apart from

134
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,450
that we have a few more modules in

135
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,789
Python including this answer cache and

136
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,280
I'll talk about what that is in just a

137
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,590
second all right now these are the three

138
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,590
main components inside of our Python

139
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,169
tools suite here and let's take a look

140
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,419
at how all of these actually incorporate

141
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,970
together however the thing is this is

142
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,190
running locally on my system and why

143
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,870
mess around with port forwarding but we

144
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,630
could just use an croc or ngr okay and

145
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,419
so of course in the cloud here we've got

146
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,190
n G R and the Jeremy's gonna allow

147
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,740
Lausanne to communicate with my flask

148
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,039
HTTP server now let's take a look into

149
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,410
this now one more thing I would like to

150
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,090
say here because I gonna say a huge

151
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,889
thank you to market suitor macht who is

152
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,830
actually a developer advocate at IBM for

153
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,080
actually Helen you build and fix a few

154
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,720
issues with the Alexa skills kit so the

155
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,400
thing is when you're working with a

156
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,099
stamen you want to ask or find the

157
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,110
question of the user is asking the

158
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,450
system in order to do that you not just

159
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,080
want an intent you want the fact you

160
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,570
want to raw utterance what the user set

161
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,160
unfortunately Amazon does

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,320
support this however using a workaround

163
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,940
that marks help me actually figure out

164
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,070
using slots or as we'll be talking about

165
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,020
in the actual programming part we've

166
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,590
been able to extract that raw utterance

167
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,260
and of course using that I can actually

168
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,570
send that to over to a standby and then

169
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,580
ask ten may can give the answer back a

170
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,560
good feeling all right let's take a

171
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,780
little bit of a deeper look now now of

172
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,300
course when you ask the Alexa a question

173
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
what's happening is let's just say you

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,250
say I like so ask and in this case the

175
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,490
invocation name for the application is

176
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,730
answer box okay so the this is the

177
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,390
invocation name and then you say

178
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,380
question and let's just say your

179
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,450
question is ABC doesn't matter what it

180
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,270
is okay now this is what you tell your

181
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,260
Alexa now once you give your electorate

182
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,610
questions instead of actually having

183
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,930
this quote here let's just have

184
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,610
questions of variable sleeping zoos a

185
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,169
little bit better and as a sort of

186
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,530
diagram here so let's just say you've

187
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,810
got your question so you can ask the

188
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,730
Alexa the question and you've told it

189
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,740
that you want this question to go over

190
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,320
to the answer bot invocation name

191
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,990
now once you've told that the Alexa is

192
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,400
going to try and figure out what to do

193
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,650
in this case it's going to go ahead and

194
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,940
contact the Lausanne HTTP server

195
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,560
now what Lausanne is gonna figure out is

196
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,560
actually find out what you're asking are

197
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,140
you asking a new question or are you

198
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,940
trying to figure out the answer to a

199
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,830
question you've asked previously I'll

200
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,900
talk about why this is important in just

201
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,120
a moment now I'll just pretend of course

202
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,680
we take this question through Lausanne

203
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,870
and on Luzon also sends over to the

204
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,720
flask HTTP because remember in this

205
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,930
flask HTTP HTTP we've got an endpoint

206
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,220
called Alexis

207
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,610
all right this is our end point over

208
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,580
here this is the HTTP endpoint that

209
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,310
little Santa's gonna call through ng on

210
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,030
okay and some goes through in gr okay

211
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,010
and of course comes over to the Alexa

212
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,800
skill endpoint now once it's at this

213
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,290
endpoint the interesting stuff starts to

214
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,780
happen see this endpoint is actually

215
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,390
going to contact the a stem based system

216
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,510
which itself is an isolated system now

217
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,420
as Tanmay is going to store the answer

218
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,420
in an answer - now why is this you may

219
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,360
ask you see asked an mate is efficient

220
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,640
in fact I've actually rewritten as Tammy

221
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,670
from scratch and Python to make it as

222
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,380
efficient as possible

223
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,120
it's even more a cure than the four as

224
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,730
well however it's not efficient enough

225
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,850
for Alexa to answer instantly because of

226
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,090
this Alexa doesn't really work out with

227
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,490
asked an me immediately and this is what

228
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,260
you need to do is tell Alexa the

229
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,390
question Alexa will tell you that it's

230
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,100
thinking of the answer and two or three

231
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,800
seconds later you can ask Alexa for that

232
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,110
answer because Alexa expects an

233
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,390
immediate reply from the as ten main

234
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,030
HTTP endpoint in fact let's see a demo

235
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,180
of this in action now of course this is

236
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,130
on mute so it's actually unmute our

237
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,480
Alexa and take a look at how the

238
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,560
application works Alexa ask answer bot

239
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,190
question which company is a long Musk

240
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,990
the CEO of let me think about that

241
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,140
alright so as you can see Alexa is now

242
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,730
thinking about the answer to this

243
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,250
question and now in theory if the speech

244
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,870
recognition actually worked out nicely

245
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,150
what I should be able to do is this

246
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:20,150
Alexa asked dance Alexa asked answer but

247
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,680
I think Tesla Motors is correct with 100

248
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,140
point zero percent confidence there we

249
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,020
go that's a lot of confidence and so as

250
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,190
you can see I asked this Alexa which

251
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,350
company a lot of musk was the CEO of and

252
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,200
at guest Tesla Motors with a hundred

253
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,089
percent confidence I look at something

254
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:49,139
Deaver shall we Alexa ask answer bot

255
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:55,910
question who is the CTO of IBM Watson

256
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,720
let me think about that

257
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,579
all right it's not the Alexa is actually

258
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,139
sent the request or an ass hand meant

259
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,850
through the Lausanne Taiji platform and

260
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,129
it is now processing now for around two

261
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,660
to three seconds processing we can do

262
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,019
this

263
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,720
Alexa asked answer but I think Rob PI is

264
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,670
correct with fifty eight point two one

265
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,160
two percent confidence there we go as

266
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,319
you can see it says raw high as the

267
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,199
correct answer and Rob high of course my

268
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,149
mentor is indeed the correct answer

269
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,079
here's a CTO now though let's take a

270
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,449
look at one last quick demo on the mill

271
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,490
get back over to the actual architecture

272
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,759
of the system itself let's take a look

273
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,899
Alexa ask answer bot question which

274
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,050
company is the largest fast-food chain

275
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,730
in the world let me think about that all

276
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,129
right Alexis thinking again it's sent

277
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:52,199
back request over to ask tan may ask him

278
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,029
is doing the old processing using IBM

279
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:59,449
Watson and now Alexa asked answer but I

280
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:02,309
think McDonald is correct with ninety

281
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,769
six point six to one percent confidence

282
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:07,379
that went very smoothly and so as you

283
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,990
can see as Tammy was able to give us the

284
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,389
correct answer and it's to this super

285
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,029
portable super convenient Alexa

286
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,559
interface anyway back to the

287
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,089
architecture hope you enjoyed that demo

288
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,589
you'll be seeing a lot more in the

289
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,749
programming part all right so now of

290
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:23,670
course we've got this entire system and

291
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,220
you now understand why the answer cache

292
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,009
is important and this is also why we

293
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,290
can't just have one individual endpoint

294
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,179
we can't just have the Alexa skill

295
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,629
endpoint we need to have one extra now

296
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,910
this extra endpoint is going to allow

297
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,720
this lausanne HCP to actually grab but

298
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,550
the answer once asked Tammy is done

299
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,970
processing now this endpoint is called

300
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,850
slash yet

301
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,209
answer alright

302
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,859
in fact gel so you have to see a little

303
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,689
bit of a clearer picture of what these

304
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,639
endpoints actually do let's list down

305
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,220
the endpoints over here now of course at

306
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,869
first they are HTTP endpoints we've got

307
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:12,720
the Alexa skill endpoint all right now /

308
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,749
Alexa skill now the parameter so this is

309
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:23,549
going to take in first of all it's going

310
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:27,959
to take the question and this is the

311
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,850
question that the user asks number two

312
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,779
it's going to take the user ID now this

313
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,749
is actually just user in the rest call

314
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:42,600
and users a unique user identification

315
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,479
number that Amazon gives us it's a very

316
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,209
long string that actually gives us the

317
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,789
ID of this user it's entirely unique to

318
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,519
that user and we use this to store their

319
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,769
answer in the answer cache without you

320
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,359
can restore the question which other

321
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,059
people may have asked as well alright

322
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,669
now after that though we of course do

323
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,649
have no more end point and an end point

324
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:11,519
is the slash get answer HTTP endpoint in

325
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,389
terms of parameters we take only one

326
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,869
parameter and this is the user ID

327
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:24,659
parameter and the reason we take this

328
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,699
parameter of course is to find out what

329
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,489
the users answer is and it returns a

330
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:32,339
string which is exactly what the Alexa

331
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,139
needs to say out you know what it said I

332
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,600
think MacDonald is the correct answer

333
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,720
with such percent confidence that is

334
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,400
exactly the string that get answer

335
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,350
actually outputs and that's what a

336
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,620
steaming computes and so this string

337
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,870
will go back over Lausanne and into

338
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,160
Alexa Lake south

339
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,080
so now imagine this you've asked your

340
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,300
question to Alex already but now when

341
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,910
you want to retrieve the answer to your

342
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,310
question so you send the retrieve

343
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,610
command all right so you sent the

344
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,280
retrieve command and this is of course

345
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,130
with our red to get answer end point and

346
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,070
so once you send this over to your

347
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,070
Lausanne to HTTP what's going to happen

348
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,160
is again through ngr okay lo Santa's

349
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,270
going to go over to the get answer

350
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,160
once it's applicant answer endpoint is

351
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,230
again world of fun starts to come in

352
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,510
because what's going to happen now is

353
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,490
it's going to go over into the answer

354
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,120
cache and it's going to ask for that and

355
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,910
for that user IDs answer the answer

356
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,280
cache is going to send a response and

357
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,200
this time what's going to happen is

358
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,740
through ng R okay it's going to respond

359
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,310
over to lo sont and the Mossad is going

360
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,310
to send this final response and let's

361
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,500
just say this goes over through Lausanne

362
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,300
it's going to send it over to oral exam

363
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,070
and it's going to tell their likes of

364
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,370
exactly what it needs to say and this is

365
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,650
one of the architecture diagram of what

366
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,410
all truly happens see the best part of

367
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,089
using the Lassonde as you platform once

368
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,970
more is that we need to do almost no

369
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,660
code at all for the alexis kill the only

370
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,750
real code here is this part this part in

371
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,730
this part that's it everything that's

372
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,580
not Python requires no code and it's not

373
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,709
entirely and a graphical user interface

374
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,840
whether it be with the Alexa skills kit

375
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,360
console or development environment or

376
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,710
whether it be the Lausanne - IOT

377
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,840
platform their graphical user interface

378
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,940
and gr ok isn't really anything you need

379
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,160
to program with anyway and then of

380
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,260
course under the Python flask issues if

381
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,030
you relatively simple flask server I'll

382
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,410
be showing you the code behind that

383
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,450
just a minute the ants will catch again

384
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,150
very very simple code and asked a mate

385
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,600
that's where the real meat comes in

386
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,370
itself does have quite a few different

387
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,650
steps what it's able to do is actually

388
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,200
use a search engine in this case it uses

389
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,020
the Google Search API and what it does

390
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,200
is it doesn't actually extract pages it

391
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,150
doesn't extract four pages from which to

392
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,750
find answers

393
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,530
it only extracts summaries what do I

394
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,390
mean by summaries well it actually is a

395
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,130
step called search and results summary

396
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,710
extraction and you know when you google

397
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,940
something and you see those little

398
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,190
descriptions under the little links that

399
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,930
show the parts of the webpage that are

400
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,390
most important to your query that is

401
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,550
what asked and may actually parses it's

402
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,650
going to grab all those from the API and

403
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,570
it's going to use a bi-directional

404
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,030
attention flow from a Linnea I would buy

405
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,250
own sort of modifications to that and

406
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,080
what it's going to do is try and find

407
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,090
some kind of answers to it it's also

408
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,190
going to use IBM Watson natural language

409
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,490
classifier and to find out what kind of

410
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,290
response are looking for whether it be a

411
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,020
person organization or location once it

412
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,550
knows what they're looking for it'll

413
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,110
filter out according to that using the

414
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,720
natural language understanding API to

415
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,460
find out what all the different answers

416
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,830
are and then once it's done that's what

417
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,420
you do a little bit of naive answer

418
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,730
scoring try and score based off a

419
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,620
repetition and if it's also going to

420
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,170
score based off a PageRank score so you

421
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,430
know that Google uses the PageRank

422
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,230
algorithm along with now a different

423
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,570
deep learning algorithms but it's going

424
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,940
to use that score in order to rank

425
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,370
better answers that are towards the top

426
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,860
of the list with more confidence and

427
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,110
that is how the entire ask 10ms system

428
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,240
works of course as Tanmay and how it

429
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,850
works is an entire video in itself but

430
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,230
in essence it's able to use a

431
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,430
combination of tensorflow

432
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,990
Watson natural language understanding

433
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,850
and what's a natural language classifier

434
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,950
in order to get answers from the web

435
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,650
from your natural language questions so

436
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,570
that's a quick brief of a Stan there

437
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,820
what that does and everything else

438
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,920
including the Alexa skill the Lausanne

439
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,160
platform and John okay the flask HTTP

440
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,730
server

441
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,490
and the answer - Tammi work together and

442
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,279
how they actually enable me to ask this

443
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,919
Alexa and natural language question and

444
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,389
get an answer around 95% of the time

445
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:05,769
alright so I hope you enjoyed that quick

446
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,809
demo and of course the architecture

447
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,669
explanation of how exactly this all

448
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:12,429
works now though what I'd like to do is

449
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:14,590
I'd like to take you over to the

450
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,090
programming part where I'm going to show

451
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,789
you how you can actually build a skill

452
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,159
for this Alexa and I'm gonna take you

453
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,230
through how exactly I built this entire

454
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,019
system how you take the wrong uh turns

455
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:31,870
from the Alexa skills over alright let's

456
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,389
get into the programming part now

457
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:36,250
alright so welcome back and now let's

458
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,510
take a look at how you can actually

459
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,690
implement this Alexa system alright now

460
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,639
what I'd like to do first of all is show

461
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:44,559
you what's actually going on in the back

462
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,169
end now I've actually got my Alexa here

463
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:47,679
with me

464
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,090
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna turn

465
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,940
this on unmute it and I'm gonna go over

466
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,880
to a four so you can see the Amazon

467
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,220
Alexa skills get here but I'm also going

468
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,809
to go over to these two terminal windows

469
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:01,029
these eternal windows contain of course

470
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,460
the ng ROK server is actually running on

471
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,309
our custom sub domain actually and of

472
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,440
course on this side over here I've got

473
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,929
my Python server which is hosting the

474
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:15,010
flask HTTP endpoints of get answer and

475
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,500
Alexa skill and of course it's also

476
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,110
hosting the answer cache and contacts as

477
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,210
Tanmay in fact an entirely new

478
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,760
redesigned version of a statement as

479
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,950
well all right let's take a look now

480
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,080
let's actually I want to run a quick

481
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,450
demo on the actual device and let's take

482
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,549
a look at how these two terminal widows

483
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:36,010
actually react let's ask it a simple

484
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,789
question like just for example Alexa ask

485
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:43,600
answer boffed question who is the CEO of

486
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,029
Amazon let me think about that alright

487
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:51,039
as you can see the Alexis now thinking

488
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,490
about it and Angra has received the HTTP

489
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,399
request it returned 200 ok response and

490
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,350
you can actually see that asked Anna

491
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,840
over here has actually received a

492
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,049
question who is the CEO of Amazon

493
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:07,059
person who actually sucked this is this

494
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,639
user ID and as you can see asked him

495
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:11,679
extracted the answer i think jeff bezos

496
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,289
etcetera and it said that this answer is

497
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:17,710
for user ID etc etc in fact we can

498
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,749
actually now go back over to our Alexa

499
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:23,860
and say Alexa ask answer bot

500
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,519
I think Jeff Bezos is correct with

501
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,590
seventy two point six to two percent

502
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,139
confidence alright so as you can see the

503
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,929
Alexa was able to detect that or not the

504
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:36,909
Alexa the election was able to send our

505
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:40,389
user ID over to asked and may ask Tammy

506
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:42,519
is get answer was actually able to take

507
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,580
that user ID and I was able to extract

508
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,799
the correct answer associated to that

509
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,590
user IDs question and that is how the

510
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,059
system works in fact you can even see

511
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:53,889
that certified right and you're okay

512
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,840
over here who is actually getting those

513
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,109
requests but wait even ngr okay has to

514
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:00,940
receive its requests from loccent

515
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,859
so let's take a look a little bit deeper

516
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:05,739
into how the system is built in fact I'm

517
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:07,509
actually going to link to a guide on the

518
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:09,850
low sound blog that's how you can build

519
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,190
an interactive Alexa skill with no code

520
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,759
using this lausanne alright so this is

521
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,869
going to be in the description you can

522
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,700
actually take a look at this tutorial is

523
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,070
going to be very helpful even actually

524
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,149
where you're breathing when you're

525
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:23,739
building this application in this

526
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,049
tutorial I'd recommend you take a look

527
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,059
at this blog as well just to find out a

528
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:30,519
bit more about lausanne - how it works

529
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,730
and what it's meant to do in fact to say

530
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,190
you know this is actually the arrest API

531
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,919
that Alexis till end point is actually

532
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,049
calling just for example if I were to go

533
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,179
localhost 5000 which is the port it's

534
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,009
running on go to the Alexis skill

535
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,049
endpoint pass the question in this case

536
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:49,059
who is the CEO of Apple and give it any

537
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:52,239
random user name like ABC I run that go

538
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:54,489
back over here as you can see a Stanley

539
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,139
has received the question and the

540
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:59,109
username ask Tammy is now going to reply

541
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:02,019
and as you can see Google Chrome gets

542
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,269
the response back and now this is what

543
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:05,889
actually goes back to Lausanne well

544
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,389
we're back into the answer cache and

545
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:08,950
then when you ask for the answer

546
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,509
Lausanne is going to receive from the

547
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:12,609
answer - and give it back to you like so

548
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:15,159
all right but let's start from the

549
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:17,649
basics here let's start from the Amazon

550
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:18,490
Alexis

551
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,740
Gill's k now the Amazon Alexa skills kit

552
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,110
we can build chat BOTS and other kinds

553
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,690
of skills for the Alexa now I like the

554
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,640
new console that they built but you can

555
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,200
use the old one as well if you'd like to

556
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,850
at least for the time being there we go

557
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,740
alright so as you can see these are all

558
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,860
my Amazon Alexa skills you know Tenma QA

559
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,580
and asked handmade v2 that's Tanmay so

560
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,700
it's actually go ahead and click on edit

561
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,620
now when I click on edit you can see all

562
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,720
the stuff that goes into this

563
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,520
application let's start with the

564
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,530
interaction model now the interaction

565
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,120
model has something called an invocation

566
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,429
an invocation is how the user actually

567
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,700
begins and talks to Alexa like just for

568
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,830
example let's just say your invocation

569
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,350
name was daily horoscopes you could say

570
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,690
something like Alexa asked daily

571
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,429
horoscopes with a horoscope for Jen and

572
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:12,040
I which is the example that Amazon gives

573
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,920
us here in this case my invocation name

574
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,590
is answer bot so people can say Alexa

575
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,500
ask answer bot question who is the CEO

576
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,720
of IBM where Amazon or any other kind of

577
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,790
question that you may have there are a

578
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,800
few requirements to your invocation name

579
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,380
like you cannot have phrases like launch

580
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,620
ask tell load begin our naval or even

581
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,840
wake words like Alexa Amazon echo

582
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,690
computer or the word skilar app so these

583
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,280
are the different sort of requirements

584
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,070
for your a vocation name but that's all

585
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,410
once you've got a good invocation name

586
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,179
and you're ready to continue we can

587
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:48,940
start off by creating a slot type now

588
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,010
before we actually create a slot type

589
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,260
though we have to understand intense if

590
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,630
you've ever used the IBM Watson

591
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,010
conversations in this before or for that

592
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,200
matter API today yeah I or any other

593
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,330
kind of chat platform you're familiar

594
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,580
with these intents but you may not be

595
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,290
familiar with slots so let's talk about

596
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,500
that now inside of the intents we only

597
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,540
have one intent and it's called the

598
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,150
everything intent remember this chat bot

599
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,160
does nothing the only thing that really

600
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,890
does something is asked and a so you

601
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,140
want to take what ever the user says no

602
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,330
matter what it may be and send it over

603
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,790
to lausanne and lausanne can do the

604
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,760
actual post processing and understand

605
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,440
what the user actually bent so with

606
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,970
everything intent we basically try and

607
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,950
capture everything that the user says

608
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,259
now this includes no matter what they

609
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:38,789
say they can say question they can say

610
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:41,070
everything intent but then after that

611
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,980
whatever they say after the first word

612
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,960
will be considered part of the

613
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,809
everything slot and the everything slot

614
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,120
is meant to pick up whatever the user

615
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,090
sets doesn't matter what it is and

616
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,039
everything slot as you can see over here

617
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,860
has under the intent slot is actually a

618
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,710
specific slot type the slot type is bag

619
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,230
of words now this is a custom slot type

620
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,879
Animas on doesn't provide this by

621
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:07,980
default and so what you need to do is

622
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,590
create a custom slot type this slot type

623
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,169
you can give it any value in this case

624
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:15,600
we've given at hello world unless you as

625
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,250
a user specify something else in your

626
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,970
intent which is what you should do now

627
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,379
of course you don't need to give us any

628
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,539
meaningful intent or meaningful value

629
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,399
you just need something in order to be

630
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,019
able to capture everything and send it

631
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:31,830
over to IBM Watson in fact if you take a

632
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,350
look at the IBM code pattern for the

633
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,190
Alexa you can take a look over here that

634
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,440
as I was mentioning just wait for this

635
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,549
to load for a second Marc Stuart Avant

636
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:47,159
and Nicholas haidle off worked on this

637
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,409
code pattern together and they use I of

638
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:52,409
the Amazon Alexa and IBM Watson in order

639
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,000
to discuss the weather and milla

640
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,610
conversations or really just choose one

641
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,029
from a library and so this is actually

642
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:02,759
based off of IBM's first of open wisk so

643
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,830
this is of course IBM's sort of us

644
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,769
compute platform similar to AWS lambda

645
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,559
and so of course this code pattern is

646
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,429
basically it's quite similar to my code

647
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:17,490
to my code in the way how it actually

648
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,710
allows Alexa to communicate with the IBM

649
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,929
cloud functions or in this case about

650
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:24,480
the idea functions but Lausanne to IOT

651
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,259
platform alright I'll tell a little bit

652
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:31,200
deeper into this now you know how the

653
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,870
intents and the slots work once you

654
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,909
built your intention your slots all you

655
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,679
need to do is save and build your model

656
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,779
once you've saved and built your model

657
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,940
though you are ready to actually test

658
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,100
your application now this is where you

659
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,340
can actually test out

660
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,010
your Amazon Alexa app before that though

661
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,500
let's head over to Lausanne now as I

662
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,110
mentioned no code involved however if

663
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,760
you want put some code in and get a

664
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,680
little bit more flexible there you can

665
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,270
and that's what I've gone ahead and done

666
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,410
but this is what the Lausanne flow looks

667
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,390
like and so as you can see I can just

668
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,250
format a little bit here as you can see

669
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,110
it's a very sort of graphical user

670
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,780
interface similar to IBM IOT ZnO to read

671
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,650
which is open source I wanna close on

672
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,410
however basically what I'm doing with

673
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,160
those on here

674
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,770
and I'm creating a web hook now this wet

675
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,350
book is basically the HTTP endpoint that

676
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,560
the Alexa skills kid calls how does it

677
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,780
call it well if you go over to build

678
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,020
over here if you just wait for one

679
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,260
second as you can see there is a button

680
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,090
for the endpoint and of course you can

681
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,770
actually get that over here as well if

682
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,540
you click on endpoint you can either

683
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,230
choose AWS laptop or an HTTP server in

684
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,570
this case I've given it to my Lausanne

685
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,150
trigger and of course you to choose if

686
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,860
this my development endpoint is so

687
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,390
domain of the domain that has a wildcard

688
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,250
certificate term a certificate authority

689
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,150
doesn't matter

690
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,310
that's just what Lausanne tells us does

691
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,020
choose because that's how Lausanne

692
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,650
destructure

693
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,560
anyway once the web hook receives

694
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,400
information from the alexis skills kit

695
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,650
then though we actually call a custom

696
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,160
function now this is a function coded in

697
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,830
JavaScript that I've created it's a very

698
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,170
simple function all this function does

699
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,080
is it actually checks whether the intent

700
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,320
is to actually ask a question or if the

701
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,210
intent is to find the answer to a

702
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,490
question that they had asked before if

703
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,380
they want to find the answer to a

704
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,570
question they've already asked then Dana

705
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,360
dot works is at the zero or else it's at

706
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,790
to one if they actually want to ask a

707
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,700
question once that function actually

708
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,950
goes through there's a conditional this

709
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,810
conditional is whether or not they

710
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,960
actually want to ask a question if they

711
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,700
do want to ask question that it goes

712
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,640
down through this flow in this flow we

713
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,970
actually respond to the alexa and we say

714
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,740
let me think about that which is why

715
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,690
alexa says let me think about that when

716
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,200
you ask

717
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,750
question and then over here with the

718
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,080
HTTP what happens is your question is

719
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,559
sent over to that mg ROK server and of

720
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,120
course the question is passed and the

721
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,580
question in this case is if I make this

722
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,940
a little bit bigger data body dot

723
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,700
request on intents lotsa everything slot

724
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,159
that value if you go huland JSON that

725
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,110
the Alexa skills kit provides in the web

726
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,179
hook this is exactly what it looks like

727
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:27,279
and then the user ID is given over here

728
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,830
which allows of course asked me to keep

729
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:33,039
its answer cache all right so once asked

730
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,260
M has gotten the request and it starts

731
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,630
doing its own processing and of course

732
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,059
Alexa's already told you that it's it's

733
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:42,010
it's thinking about what the actual

734
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,769
response should be and so now two or

735
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,809
three seconds later when you ask Alexa

736
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:50,289
to retrieve and when you ask Alexa to

737
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:52,149
actually get the answer to your question

738
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:55,000
then a the conditional goes over through

739
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,519
this branch now in the conditional ghost

740
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,289
of this branch it still does make an

741
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:02,139
HTTP request in this case the request

742
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,639
goes to a slightly different end point

743
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:06,130
they get answer end point and this time

744
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,380
not the question but only the user ID is

745
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,260
sent now once you actually receive a

746
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,480
response from the HTTP endpoint in fact

747
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,889
if you were to take a look here it

748
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:18,519
stores that result in data to ask Tammy

749
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,970
and then I've got a a custom JavaScript

750
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,309
function and what this does is it

751
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,980
actually creates an Alexa response now

752
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,470
if you remember over here we sent a

753
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,620
reply to Alexa and we sent some JSON and

754
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,840
the text was let me think about it in

755
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,210
this function what I do is I create a

756
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,970
similar JSON variable but in this case

757
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,659
the text is payload data asked and made

758
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:44,320
up body

759
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,110
now remember asked animate is the result

760
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,760
from the asked anime endpoint and body

761
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,429
is what asked him a returned and so

762
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:53,169
we're basically taking whatever asked an

763
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:55,360
air turned and we are basically we are

764
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,909
essentially giving it over to Alexa and

765
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,639
then of course we reply with this Alexa

766
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:03,340
response over to the Alexa and again

767
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,769
since this happens practically instantly

768
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:08,649
just a little bit of latency it's it's

769
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:12,500
good enough for Alexa to to not say

770
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,090
the request timed out or anything that

771
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,640
anything of that sort but now though

772
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,830
let's see a little bit of a deeper dive

773
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,530
into what Lausanne to seize from its end

774
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,280
so now what we can actually do is find a

775
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,770
few debug notes all right now these

776
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,020
debug notes allow us to actually print

777
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,320
out what the system is seeing or

778
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,630
basically doing at each step so we can

779
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,630
actually print out the result from the

780
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,770
actual web hook and this the web hook

781
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,720
debug and let's just message this as log

782
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,830
for web hook all right now when this

783
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,170
when when the web hook when the web

784
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,180
hooks results printed it's going to tell

785
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,010
us that this is the log for the web walk

786
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,030
web look we can do a similar debug for

787
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,820
for example let's just say over here we

788
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,670
can take a similar debug after this

789
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:15,920
function all right and then after this

790
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,600
function we can take a look at what the

791
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,410
actual result was final function debug

792
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,010
or lock and then what's to put one more

793
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,970
debug here why not and let's connect

794
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:35,120
this to HTTP there we go all right so

795
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,860
now we've got our D bugs in the right

796
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,570
places let's just say asked and I'm

797
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,630
going to deploy this workflow to figure

798
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,640
out there all right so just deploy this

799
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,370
workflow and as you can see the workflow

800
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,830
has been saved and deployed now if we

801
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,480
were to go ahead and ask the Alexa

802
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,490
another question it should actually

803
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,550
print out everything in lausanne if we

804
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,290
go over to our debug I'll just replace

805
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,960
remove all the previous locks and let's

806
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,800
go over into our alexis field yes go

807
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,900
into the testing and now what I'm gonna

808
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,330
do is test out the Alexa now either I

809
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,890
can talk to my computer and it'll

810
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,900
simulate the Alexa or I can just type it

811
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,910
in let's try typing it in and then next

812
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,640
we'll try actually um saying it so it

813
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:25,470
will say ask answer bot question

814
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:31,190
found it let's just say Amazon why not

815
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:36,810
I'm gonna send this over as you can see

816
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,880
Alexa replies let me think about that of

817
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,500
course that's exactly what we expect and

818
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,450
that's what lausanne replied but let's

819
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,250
take a look at what all lausanne to

820
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,040
actually saw as you can see we have two

821
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,990
different logs here why not three

822
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,000
because this was never called now the

823
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,859
first one is the log for webhook

824
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,050
as you can see Orion as the web hook was

825
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,940
actually triggered this is all the data

826
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,400
that we had in our payload which is the

827
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,960
sort of group of information that we've

828
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,380
got in this entire workflow now data is

829
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,690
where we actually try or is where we

830
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,030
actually start to get all the data that

831
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,550
came from the web hook now inside data

832
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,109
we've got the body and this is the

833
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:15,960
actual information that the Alexa sent

834
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,020
over now inside of request you can see

835
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,740
the intent the intent of the attain

836
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,630
group over here and the name of this

837
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,310
intent is everything intent and there's

838
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,099
no confirmation now under slots however

839
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,800
and under everything slot you can see

840
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,099
that the values who founded Amazon

841
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:36,359
sounds like a little bit of a workaround

842
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,950
because we can't get the raw utterance

843
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,290
so it is but until Amazon actually

844
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,970
provides us the functionality you can

845
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,190
get the raw utterance we won't be able

846
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,079
to use anything but this kind of

847
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,849
workaround but it's a very good

848
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:48,839
workaround nonetheless

849
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,910
and of course again huge thank you to

850
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,290
mark for actually helping me implement

851
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,329
this as you can see of course they're

852
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:56,160
resolutions that doesn't matter all that

853
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,440
really matters is the value and since

854
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,390
the application realized that the value

855
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,329
is indeed a valid question it sent this

856
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:06,060
over through this line instead of this

857
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,010
line which meant that as ten may

858
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,520
actually received that question and it's

859
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,990
now processing in fact if we go over

860
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,540
here you can see that ng ROK received it

861
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,819
and as you can see asked how they

862
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,980
received it here as well and it has

863
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,650
created the earth has thought of the

864
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,490
answer that has replied and sorted in

865
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,310
the answer cache of course all right so

866
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,050
after the log for web hook there's also

867
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,849
the asked and a result log because

868
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:35,400
remember when you actually call slash

869
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,010
Alexis kill endpoint we actually don't

870
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,850
return anything

871
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,220
the Alexa but the end point itself does

872
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,100
return some JSON and so that JSON is

873
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,770
never actually saved in the I guess you

874
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,460
could say in the payload however it D is

875
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,880
actually replied nonetheless alright

876
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,560
next though let's go back over to our

877
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,200
alexa simulator and let's try actually

878
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,250
using the the speaking feature ask

879
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:11,100
answer bot question retrieve okay so as

880
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,010
you can see Alexa's voice voice

881
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,750
recognition hasn't really worked out

882
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,280
that well due to the fact that my

883
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,140
microphone setup isn't optimal right now

884
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,900
it's a little a little funky but if I

885
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,520
were to go ahead and type in our

886
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,860
question once more as you can see it's

887
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,810
thinking about that once more oh we can

888
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,820
go back here in fact let's go over to

889
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,190
Lausanne and you delete all of our logs

890
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,170
because we don't want all that noise in

891
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,330
there let's go back over here and say

892
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:43,710
ask answer bot question retrieve don't

893
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:49,530
worry let's try that once more all right

894
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,410
as you can see Alexa does in fact

895
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,210
respond with I think Jeff Bezos is

896
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,040
correct in forty six point six three

897
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,110
eight percent confidence and that is

898
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,100
indeed correct Jeff Bezos founded Amazon

899
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,210
now of course if we were to go back to

900
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,190
Lausanne you know that this time of

901
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,560
course a log for web hooks he'll Silla

902
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,000
actually went through which is why this

903
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,490
is printed out but after that this

904
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,320
conditional went through this branch

905
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,360
instead of this one and so through this

906
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,610
branch the function goes down and we

907
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,110
actually print out the result as well

908
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,880
now if you take a look in the final

909
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,070
function log we have of course our

910
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,440
regular body and everything but we also

911
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,420
have to ask Tanmay response and this is

912
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,940
what asked and they responded from the

913
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,730
get answer endpoint and then we've got

914
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,040
the Alexa response and this is exactly

915
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,410
the JSON that is sent over to the Alexa

916
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,450
and then the Alexa is able to make sense

917
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,520
of it and actually respond with this

918
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,140
text and that is how the lausanne to IOT

919
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,450
platform ties in with this entire system

920
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,910
in general this is all able to combine

921
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,950
in order to

922
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,890
to create an Alexis skill that uses the

923
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,700
power of ask Tanmay in order to answer

924
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,020
your natural language questions and so

925
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,540
that sums up how you can build an Amazon

926
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,460
Alexis skill and not just any skill in

927
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,620
fact quite a complex skill but with

928
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,200
hardly any coding involved only answer

929
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,390
cash the asset and a system flattens all

930
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,400
you need to code everything else on the

931
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,680
Alexis skill side is all done without

932
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,590
code whatsoever I really do hope you

933
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,910
enjoyed this tutorial and that you're

934
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,140
able to create your own I like some

935
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,210
skills as well of course thank you very

it'll be available down in the

953
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,230
description below ask 10-man will be

954
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,850
updated on github very soon as well

955
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,730
after some minor code cleanup within the

956
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,050
next few days you'll be seeing an

957
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,550
entirely we were in version of asked him

958
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,370
