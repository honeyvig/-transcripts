2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,320
solo there and welcome to another

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,990
tutorial my name is Tamara Bakshi and

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,520
this time we're going to be going over

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,519
how you can use a Lambo fire in Iowa and

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,369
switch it wanna make HTTP GET request

7
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,859
and in this case we're going to be using

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,669
the HTTP band example ref API in order

9
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,370
to basically send a very simple HTTP GET

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,770
request through Valero fire to a sheet

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,020
to be bare and then we're going to route

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,570
some information from a tree via HTTP

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,370
band such as these headers of the

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,950
request as well as the IP address and

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,530
much more and plus what we're going to

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,640
do is they're going to take that

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,129
information from JSON format parse that

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,160
UPS JSON serialization and then we're

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,500
going to split to the user ID privy help

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,379
to the console in Xcode now there isn't

21
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,910
much to explain here but what I would

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,850
say and thank you to labels for sending

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,240
in the question for this video and of

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,979
course I really hope do hope is we'll be

25
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,170
able to answer your question and force

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,939
you actually ask how you can use LMO

27
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,520
fire in Swift and iOS or image

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,820
asynchronous issues if you request there

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,650
will be other parts coming up soon about

30
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,009
post delete update request and more I'll

31
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,350
but for now let's go ahead and simply

32
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,900
sit with the request the get request

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,299
alright so now go over to the coding

34
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,159
part where I want to show you exactly

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,220
how you can actually code in this simple

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,619
iOS application let's get to it

37
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,229
alright so welcome back to the coding

38
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,909
part now I'm going to show you how

39
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,799
exactly you can actually implement this

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,619
ulema fire application now if I go back

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,570
to Xcode over here as you can see I've

42
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,729
got this little Xcode window set up as

43
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,610
well as this short code now if I go to

44
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,619
my iOS simulator which is actually

45
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,600
running this code and if I click on the

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,210
screen once and go back to Xcode as you

47
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,340
can see Xcode has printed out three

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,530
different objects the first object is

49
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,780
the raw JSON value received from HDTV

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,790
bin the second one is the IP address

51
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,390
origin from HTTP bin

52
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,340
and of course the third one is the URL

53
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,880
or the request that we sent to HTTP bin

54
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,440
all right not me flame what's actually

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,750
going on behind the scenes in the code

56
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,180
now what's happening here is first of

57
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,860
all in touch us again whenever you click

58
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,110
on the view the make requests function

59
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,970
called invited me request

60
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,310
I then call something called the request

61
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,470
function the request function is a part

62
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,930
of the Olin mo fire framework i packet

63
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,730
the URL that i'd like to call and by

64
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,800
default this may get requests and that's

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,640
why I'm calling

66
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,360
slash get on HDTV been org I then look

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,100
for a JSON response

68
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,560
what's a lamb a fire gathers this JSON

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,900
response order swans in general then we

70
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,580
store the response and variable called

71
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,160
response and recall this callback

72
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,380
handler and they say what this means is

73
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,000
that this function or this block of code

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,700
will be called right as a responsive

75
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,260
gained from this request

76
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,650
now remember something about this which

77
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,030
is that let's just say I want to make a

78
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,070
long-running request where let's just

79
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,750
say I have to upload files this can't

80
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,860
request or to this get in Oh HTTP server

81
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,030
if I want to say print hello this is

82
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,150
message to and inside of the block of

83
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,390
code I were to say hello this is method

84
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,850
one then what would happen even message

85
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,650
to a print first and then misses one

86
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,230
this is because when you call request

87
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,870
this isn't called mmediately request is

88
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,610
called and now allow a fire has started

89
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,730
to make the request to the HTTP server

90
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,230
then what happens is it go ahead and run

91
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,330
this code while in the background it's

92
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,370
actually still making the HTTP request

93
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,299
once the HTTP request is over then this

94
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,390
line of code or whatever main code is is

95
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,820
stopped and this code is then run and

96
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,480
then it continues from there and so what

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,370
happens is number two will be printed

98
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,620
and then number one will be printed this

99
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,360
might not happen right now because the

100
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,880
HTTP vendor or request is practically

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,920
instant but sometimes it may happen

102
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,370
depending on the internet speed now this

103
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,079
is going to run on to my iPhone

104
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,479
simulator and if I just click on and

105
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,270
screen here oh as you can see if there

106
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,950
happen luckily my internet speed wasn't

107
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,169
fast enough and it said hello this is

108
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:27,800
message

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,780
you it then printed everything else that

110
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,449
I wanted it to and then said hello this

111
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:35,720
is message one alright so that is how

112
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,310
you can implement that but just one more

113
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,169
thing I'd like to show you here is how

114
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,500
we are actually parsing our JSON now the

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,110
point here one parsing the JSON is

116
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,759
actually that the fact that a lambo

117
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,800
choir already uses ash trees on

118
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,349
serialization in the backend to parse

119
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,090
the JSON for us and then returns the

120
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,699
JSON as in any object not in any object

121
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,229
but on any on any type and so what we do

122
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:01,879
is I mean this can be optional because

123
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,849
LMO fire may not have received json from

124
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:07,490
the request or from the HTTP server and

125
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,949
so what i do is i reminisce LED on it

126
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:12,169
and I say it's the value of the result

127
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,740
in response it's not mailed and put that

128
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,139
in JSON and then create a new variable

129
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:21,830
called JSON object and set this to the

130
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,969
JSON as a string and object dictionary

131
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:28,310
then we then have constants origin and

132
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,360
URL inside of origin we are setting

133
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,819
origin to the origin object from the

134
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,560
JSON object and what's important is to a

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,289
string as you can see that's what that

136
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:42,289
is in our JSON right there and then of

137
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:44,690
course our converting the URL object to

138
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,020
a string as well and then once we've got

139
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,789
bells we are then able to have these

140
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,919
print messages they'll actually print

141
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,440
out all that data and that is how you

142
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,770
can use a lamp wire in Swift free in

143
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,979
order to actually parse JSON responses

144
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,479
from HTTP servers and that was the

145
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,490
tutorial today I really hope you enjoyed

146
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,319
I hope this was able to solve your

147
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,360
question Vaibhav alright so thank you

really do hope you were able to learn

150
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:15,650
from this and of course if you did
