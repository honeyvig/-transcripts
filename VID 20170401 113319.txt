hi everybody I am Sparta from Mangalore
that as the question city of Karnataka
first and foremost
sorry that I couldn't make it for
today's function but at least through
this video I will be a part of today's
function okay so yes I was a part of
first MDS conquers and Eppley FL in 2016
is when I time through my sense because
I wanted a coaching wherein there is no
classroom coaching because I had to I
wanted to work for some reasons I wanted
to be in the clinic - that's how I got
to know about this coaching which is
friendly for me and then yes I started
from efforts to be a part of this from
May 1st onwards I was I had taken of
this online testing and what I thought
was like I give one try if I get
identify don't I will just do some
certificate code so that was only
intention so that's why I was not much
serious but when I became a part of this
and when I started hearing the positive
thoughts from third I thought yes if we
put a little more hard work maybe we can
do it and then what I did was I was a
full-time I am working full-time in a
clinic this is around 40 minutes away
from my place so what I used to do was I
had only two books multi-pulse part 1
and part 2
so I'd asked fer also like if I have to
take anything else and also use like
personal justice and then think about
the rest
so how my journey was like every morning
I used to read bit which is actually in
a week the difficult part which I
couldn't remember I will be around 1 or
2 hours I could be
around 10:00 I start to my clinics so a
party - I'll be in the bus that is when
I start hearing all voice notes videos
or the images whatever percent whatever
has been discussed in the group that is
when I go through then once a rich
clinic if there are patient I will be
doing this in between I will be reading
those things which I am almost sure but
are not registered I never read anything
new till one o'clock a one will be at
lunchtime so some two to four again it
is free for me that is when when I read
the sets of the topics which I have not
felt are the target of the cup that week
then from 4:30 to 7:30 again we will
have the clinic covers again there I
used to do the revision part or I used
to do those things which is little bit
lighter for me then at around seven
thirty five go back again the bus
routine will be the same I go through
the pics or whatever is there in my
mobile so through mobile reading I used
to do this two times morning bus time an
ailing busting when I reach home around
8:00 8:30 I shall have dinner and all
that and I have settled by around 9:30
10:00 and start again to read that is
why that is how I went initially so
layer but that time I was not that
better systematic like create this
reader that whichever I felt easy I used
to intern the loose timing and in the
sinus that I don't have any disturbance
values to go through this tough
difficult subject towards the end of
maybe around the August September I was
thinking about quitting clinic but I
couldn't do it
in this notice notification of reserve
exam schema penance or told to quit this
clinic so I quit the clinic from October
15 till the exam one and a half months I
was at home so during that time yeah
morning that I am I had such a dual has
housed holistic type but till October 15
to my routine was life
like this and yeah some somewhere around
the August I started solving little bit
of fishing papers which ever I had
service odious to send that hold things
and all that and also I used to go
through the weekend exam week and exams
every Sunday when I save after for
discus again I used to go through the
same Christian and I used to see where I
go wrong so that that was how my
preparation was because religion was
like only thing is in my family they
were like what do you do with your phone
all the time so I used to tell this is
something new don't worry I increase we
will see what happens but don't think
that I'm just playing with the phone
it's not playing and having lots and
lots notes in my phone and that's how I
went through with my coaching classes
because I am NOT a classroom studying
person and the classroom question which
was near my place was really it's very
expensive not looking fairly expensive
in Mangalam it was around forty thousand
thirty well you know I said that is not
that helpful for me because I had to go
to clinic also and doing my internship I
was not that serious with this
preparation because I don't know my
seniors and others used to tell that and
it's not that easy to crack in one shot
and the internship it's difficult and
all this tools I didn't want to step on
to two boats at the same time so that's
why I stressed on my hand work during
internship I I gave the exam during
internship I was totally knowledgeable
in all India I worked on 55% or
something committee occur thousand forty
but committed in widest wrote to know
where I stand
then my preparation was but one thing is
that I just followed this followed
whatever so tools and I tried managing
my time based on my training science I
just make the medicine care and that
I used to sit reply 31 and our line this
I am was this is difficult for me first
area when patients are not that I used
to study and patients I went into book
aside and do that work even by doing the
work
we keep remembering especially this
files the bird then the you know the
timing when you're picking your mouth
man the 20 minutes limit those things I
used to revise in that way also so
that's what towards the end it was it
restricts tricks tighter the last one
month I have put a little more effort
what I have not done before I used to
solve all they preferred whatever the
paper third is to put my preparation
list was or Liz's and the positive
thoughts from him and yet were delicious
from all of my delicious and now I am
really happy and actually I can tell in
my house also that you know even though
you said I am doing nothing with my
spoon I have achieved something good and
the thanks a lot stood for that thanks a
lot for all the mentors I will always
cherish this experience it was great
being a part and I am still the part of
them give conquer family so all the best
to all the rest of the council who are
doing the preparation and thank you very
much
