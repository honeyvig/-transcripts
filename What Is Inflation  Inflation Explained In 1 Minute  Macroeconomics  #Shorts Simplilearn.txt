inflation is a decrease in the
purchasing power of money which is
reflected in a general increase in the
prices of goods and services in the
country's economy
in 1980 for example a movie ticket cost
on average 2.89
by 2020 the average price of a movie
ticket had risen to 10.16
with 10
you could have watched four movies in
the 1980s but with that same amount of
money you can only watch one movie now
this decrease in movie ticket purchasing
power of the us dollar is considered
inflation
however don't think about inflation in
terms of an increase in pricing for a
single item
inflation refers to the broad increase
in prices across a sector or an industry
like the automotive food and beverages
or energy business and ultimately a
country's entire economy
