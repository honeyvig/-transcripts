hello everyone and welcome you all
so today is very exciting day because
today we're gonna talk about
xml
okay so what is the next symbol so this
we will be discussing about
in a today's session along with will be
also taking you towards a little bit
hands-on and some detailed description
about an example so that you will get
the complete clarity of what xml really
does so let's get started
so
first of all what we have it today so
we'll be talking about introduction to
xml
features of xml some advantages of xml
limitations of xml and the comparison
between html versus xml and then we'll
be having a demo
now let's get started about an xml
so we're going to start with the
introduction what is an xml
see typically we say xml stand for
extensible markup language
it is a language which we use it for
machine
okay so that we can send some
instructions to our
i would say
computerize
developed containers or some softwares
because xml is one of the very very easy
language
which we use it but it is not for a
human human sense like it is not
designed to
uh be read by human it is designed to be
read by your computer components
so it is designed to send store and
receive to display the data so it is
actually a platform
and programming language independent
that means you talk about it as a
platform and language independent
language and
where the html comes with predefined tag
xml doesn't have any predefined tag that
means
you go and create your own tags
okay
well
let's quickly talk about the features of
xml see as i said extensible and human
readable humidity means
it is not like an assembly language
which human cannot read it okay it is
not a machine language which human
cannot read it
human can read it but it is not a human
friendly
the way you see the typical languages
are there
okay
it preserve the white spaces so if you
give the extra spaces so white spaces
are actually preserved here
so the best part is what it is more
simple to use and implement
okay and
xml is all about holding the data where
the html is responsible for
presenting the data so normally we say
html is designed for presenting what
data we are trying to offer it to
display and xml is talking about what
data is
okay so there are two different ideas
now undefined tags that means you go and
create your own tags here
so
it is primarily known for holding the
data so if you want to send some
information receive some information you
put it under the xml so it is a well
structured format so we know it xml is
w3c standard so it contains all the
necessary structured information and
stuff descriptive in nature because
while seeing this you can itself you
easily make it out what is going on
inside
now advantages of xml
now the first is it is a platform
independent it supports a standard
unicode bits connector set and whenever
you want to transport any data
while sending from one language to
another language you can easily do that
so overall i can say
like the two languages which wants to
communicate with each other like in
dotnet and java so neither dot net needs
to know about a java not java needs to
know about dot net but they can send the
data
to each other in the form of xml which
both of them know how to interpret so
that is the best part of the xml
so you can say it is a completely
compatible
with java 100 portable in fact xml can
be also
be compatible with other languages to
like in php and dotnet and not
okay so as i discussed with you
for the sharing the information
and
when you want to talk about
the dtd called document type definition
this is the very old and simplified
version of the
xml where the dtd will define the schema
saying that hey this is what a document
must be formatted in that way
so when it comes to the formatting like
you talk about the document has to have
these many field so you talk about these
things when it comes to the dtd into
this picture
now the limitations of xml number one as
i discussed with you it is verbose and
drainage compared to the json because
json is the modern day language which we
use it compared to the xml which is far
more easier but you cannot avoid or you
cannot ignore the presence of xml in the
current market
high storage transportation code for
large volume data but obvious because
when you send some information in the
form of xml so certainly you require
some additional parsers
which needs to pass the data and for
that heavy pass it requires more memory
and more storage too
so it doesn't support an array okay so
just support the normal i would say the
string data which you want to carry it
now
okay so it is file size are usually
large because due to its variables in
nature so there are some limitations are
available in xml
okay so html versus xml i told you
earlier
html is all about
how to display and xml is all about what
data is
okay html is a markup language xml is
also markup language but it is all about
it offers a framework to define the
markup language
it is not a case sensitive http xml is a
case sensitive html has its own
predefined tag xml you go and create
your own tags as per your own need
so html contents are more static in
nature xml is more dynamic because it is
designed to transport the data from one
source to another source here
so it doesn't preserve the y space but
yes xml does preserve the white spaces
and then we will talk about demo now
okay everyone so let's get started it's
a demo time now
so here i will tell you about how to
develop the
exhibit document so here if you see i
have got visual studio code this visual
studio code is very simple and easy to
use editor and as a front-end developer
it is
one of the most favorite tool for
every users nowadays now here if you
want to develop this xml based
so here we have some extensions
available so if you click on extension
and search for x7
so you will see there are some
okay so xml tools are available in
formatting
okay xml documents so you see there is a
simple xml formatter which is there
okay which you can use it now so there
are multiple tools are available you can
see now
xml okay so
you have got multiple tools which are
there which you can use it
anywhere to
you can see for xml formatting
xpath s query so multiple options are
there which you can use it as per your
own
requirement
okay so
it's up to you know which one you want
to pick it up
okay so this is the xml format is one of
the
tool which is there so you can use it so
i can use this xml format is
is one of the very very common tool
which is there i'm installing this
well i close this and i go back to my
code and
create the new file and
give the name call anything suppose if i
get the name called employee.xml
okay and now you can see this extension
automatically appears
and
inside this xml
okay so
if i want to
go ahead and
start developing this
code one by one so how to start now so
the first thing i would like to always
starts with
my data so i'm saying
employees
okay so
you can see now it is also offering even
support for closing this tag
so here after that i will be using some
input by saying
employ
and
inside this employee i'll be giving the
id
and say id equal to
single quotes i can just give the value
call
like this
okay
and now
employment closing this
going forward
i can use the first name
so you see like in a first name because
see
these tags which i'm talking about there
are
custom tags they're not predefined one
okay i'm just giving the name called
john here
and
after this
okay so along with this job i just give
the name called styles
as a last name i'll be giving
title
and here
i will give the value so we can just say
engineer
okay like i can give this another one
division
and
here in this division i can offer
materials
okay
after this i can add one more property
here called building
building
in building i can give the property like
you can say
seven like this
and in the same one we can offer one
property here and that is called row
okay
and i can give the room number here
which i can say like
three two seven
okay i can say room number 19 or
anything so that's the first set of
record which i'm having right now
okay so likewise i can have
n number of records as we really want it
now
okay so let's add few more records here
here to here is an employee
and let me add
few more and here
i say format document
we call
xml format you can see it has
immediately formatted your data or the
complete file in a very very beautiful
way so here v125
and here we can just give the name call
and we can just change the name
account
and
change the name
once again
like this
so i like this i would like to
have few more records
as i can see here
we need one two
five
and give some different way if you want
qa
you can say
hr
building number
337
room number
30
okay
so like this i haven't got some records
with me
okay and now if i want to see how the
outcome would be so i can just right
click and select finder
and here when i
right click and say open with my chrome
browser
so you will see this is how the document
appears like there will be nothing every
browser does contain the same format
whether you use chrome whether you use
microsoft
edge or any other browser the option
gonna be remain
same so now we talk about one more that
is called
json
formatter and we are just saying xml
it's not a very very popular tool you
can see
xml format from here you can see that
tree structure
so here i just copy the code
and paste it here so that's what my code
which is there with me so if i just want
to say format
beautify so this is how the code would
actually look like it
okay if i want this xml tree so we can
see like there's a one object name
called implies under this we have about
three objects are available
and every object will have
seven
child inside this so this is how the
tree is gonna really look like it so
this is formatter can really offer
something very very interesting
and uh if you want to
perform
uh minify or compact so like the size if
you want to reduce it you can also
reduce the size also so that you know
you can contin you can consume the less
space
there's a call xml to json so what it
does it basically takes your xml and
convert into the form of what json
so it is a fantastic tool which you
people can use it for your general
purpose
so overall you can see friend the xml is
very popular tool okay and there are
so many options are available which you
can use it and explore it so that's it
about the next okay thank you
