the description box below with that
having said now here is a comprehensive
step by-step guide to learning machine
learning number one is skills required
number two job rolls in ml number third
compan is hiring ml engineers and the
number four is future scope of ml now
starting with the number one that is
fundamentals of machine learning
familiarize yourself with the
fundamentals of machine learning in the
initial stages of learning to drive we
are familiarized with the different
elements varieties and regulations
pertaining to operating a car it is
essential to delve into the fundamentals
of machine learning to understand what
lies ahead and the required knowledge
now moving to number two that is
acquiring Proficiency in python or our
programming language to excel in the
field of artificial intelligence and
machine learning it is crucial to
develop a strong command of python or R
programming language both Python and R
are widely used in the data science
Community due to their versatility and
extensive libraries for scientific
Computing so now moving on to the third
step that is gain knowledge of essential
python libraries for machine learning
once you have acquired Proficiency in
python as part of our machine Learning
Journey the subsequent step involves
familiarizing yourself with essential
python libraries crucial for working
with data and implementing machine
learning Solutions the key python
libraries that you should learn from
machine learning are numpy pandas
matplot lip and psyit Lear now moving to
step four that is learn and Implement
various machine learning algorithms
after gaining Proficiency in python as
part of our machine Learning Journey the
subsequent Milestone involves learning
various machine learning algorithms and
their implementation using python listed
below are some of the key machine
learning algorithms that are essential
to learning number one linear regression
number two logistic regression number
three passive aggression number four
Nave Base number five support Vector
machines now moving to step five Master
the concepts and implementation of
neural networks once you have acquired
knowledge of python and machine learning
algorithms the next significant step in
the machine learning road map is to
learn neural network architecture and
their implementations using python
outlined below are several crucial
neural network architectures that are
essential to learning number one
artificial neural networks number two
CNN number three
RNN number four long shortterm memory
now moving to step six that is engage
Hands-On projects to apply your
knowledge and reinforce your
understanding after acquiring knowledge
of python machine learning algorithms
and neural network architectures the
next crucial step is the machine
learning road map and is to gain
practical experience by working on
projects that allow you to apply what
you have learned the first project is
Iris flower classification number two
California house price prediction number
three stock price prediction number four
customer segmentation now we'll move to
job roles in machine learning machine
learning as highlighted earlier has
gained immense popularity for its
ability to elevate human efforts and and
enhance machine performance through
autonomous learning this popularity has
resulted in lucrative and sought after
career options within the field
including roles like machine learning
engineer so the duty of a machine
