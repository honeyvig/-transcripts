foreign
's YouTube channel in this session we
will learn what is data analytics
followed by the fundamentals of data
analytics we will have a brief
introduction to one of the powerful
Tools in data analytics which is none
other than the Tableau once we have a
good understanding of the fundamentals
of Tableau like data connectivity how to
create charts tables and Tableau and how
to create stories in Tableau we will get
ahead with the most important topic of
today's session which is about building
a real-time and interactive dashboard in
Tableau with that having said if you are
an aspiring data analyst looking out for
online training and certification from
the best universities and the industry
experts then search no more simply
learns postgraduate program and data
analytics from the Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be the
right choice for more details on this
program please use the link in the
description box below also let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple Technologies if you're
attacking in a continuous hunt for
latest technological Trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply learn now with that having
said
Ottawa training experts so what is w
so before we understand what exactly is
W let us imagine a simple situation
imagine that you are an office worker
and you get some loads of data uh maybe
like millions of rows or billions of
rows and you're supposed to extract the
insights of that particular data so what
do you do you basically load that data
into a database and try to write the SQL
commands and then try to extract the
insights of that particular data
so this kind of approach is basically
time consuming and you get exhausted now
what if you had a tool which could write
all the SQL commands for you in the
background and all you had to do is just
to drag and drop the data
sounds interesting right
so Tableau is just the same all you have
to do is just drag and drop the data and
it will automatically write all the SQL
commands you ever wanted to write on
that particular data and it will give
you live data interactions and advices
for the future
now with this let us understand the
definition of w so basically Tableau is
a business and analytical software tool
develop in America W helps people to
understand visualize and make data
driven decisions in real time with
extreme agility and accuracy
now with this let us continue with the
next topic which will be about the
various versions of w so at first we
have the Tableau desktop so Tableau
desktop is a data visualization
application to facilitate you to xmi in
virtually any kind of structured data
and generate highly interactive
beautiful graphs dashboards and reports
within minutes once a quick installation
you can tie to virtually any data source
from spreadsheets to data warehouses and
display information in several graphic
perspectives designed to be easy to
utilize you'll be working more rapidly
than ever before next we have the W
server it is a business intelligence
application that offers browser-based
analytics anyone can utilize it is a
rapid fire alternative to the slow pace
of traditional business intelligence
software it is an online solution meant
for sharing Distributing and
collaborating on content created in
Tableau what makes W different it is
proposed to everyone there is there is
no scripting required so everyone can
grow to be an analytics expert you can
grow your deployment as you require it
train online for free find answers and
minutes and not in months that's the
specialty of w
now followed by the W server we have W
online
so w online is a business intelligence
application that offers browser-based
analytics anyone can utilize as
discussed before it is a rapid fire
alternative to slow based additional
business intelligence software so
Tableau online is a secure cloud-based
solution for sharing and collaborating
on Tableau view views and dashboards
next up we have the Tableau public
so now I want to give you guys a serious
heads up if you are a beginner in w w
public is like an open source whatever
the data you choose to work on using
table Republic it goes to public so kind
of like w public is not preferable if
you want to work on your company
sensitive and confidential data W public
is a free software to facilitate anyone
to get connected to a spreadsheet or a
file and create interactive data
visualizations for the web
it is delivered as a service that
permits the user to be up to and running
overnight with table Republic users can
construct amazing interactive visuals
and publish them quickly without the
help of programmers or ID
it is designed for organizations to
facilitate their websites with
interactive data visualizations there
are higher limits on the size of data
you can work with and among other
features you can keep your underlying
data hidden and lastly we have W reader
W reader is a free desktop application
that you can use to open and interact
with data visualizations built in
Tableau desktop web tab new reader you
can filter drill down and discover
humongous loads of data now moving ahead
we have the features of w
so these are the few important features
that you might want to consider
those are the first one robust security
table you take special care of data and
user security it has a foolproof
Security based authentication and
permission systems for data connections
and user success
W also gives you the freedom to
integrate with other security protocols
such as active directory Kerberos Etc an
important point to note here is that the
W practices low level filtering which
helps in keeping the data secure
followed by that we have the
collaboration and sharing feature tabli
provides convenient options to
collaborate with other users and
instantly share data in the form of
visualizations sheets dashboards Etc in
real time it allows you to securely
share data from various data sources
such as on-premise on-cloud hybrid Etc
instant and easy collaboration and data
sharing helps in getting quick reviews
or feedback on data leading to a better
overall analysis of it another extremely
useful feature of Tableau is the use of
Time series and forecasting easy
creation of trend lines and forecasting
is possible due to tablets powerful
backend and dynamic front-end you can
easily get data predictions such as a
forecast or a trend line by simply
selecting some options and drag and drop
operations using your concerned fields
next up we have live and in-memory data
Tableau ensures connectivity with both
live data sources and data extraction
from external sources as in memory data
this gives the user the flexibility to
use the data from more than one type of
data source without any restrictions you
can use data directly from data source
by establishing Library connections or
keep that data in memory by extracting
data from a data source as per their
requirement
W provides additional features to
support data connectivity such as an
automatic extract refreshes notifying
the user upon live connection fail Etc
next we have informative View and even
the mobile view one of the key features
of Tableau and the one that got its
popularity is its wide range of
visualizations in W you can make
visualizations such as bar chart pie
chart Gantt chart bullet chart motion
chart tree map box plot and many more
like you name it w got it you can select
and create any kind of visualizations
easily by selecting the visualization
type from the show me tab apart from
that it is capable to represent data in
mobile view as well W acknowledges the
importance of mobile phones in today's
world and provides the mobile versions
of Tableau app the next and the last
feature is that being capable of
accessing data from various kinds of
data sources W offers a wide range of
data source options where you can get
connected and frustrated from data
sources ranging from on-premise files
spreadsheets relational databases
non-relational databases online cloud
data for data warehouses and many more
so followed by the features now we'll
discuss about the advantages of w
so following are the advantages of using
Tableau first one it has remarkable
visualization capabilities of course the
unparalleled capabilities of visualizing
information is on top of the list of tab
values software benefits followed by
that we have the ease of use the tools
intuitive manner of creating graphics
and a user-friendly interface allows
non-developers to utilize the basic apps
functionalities to the fullest users
arrange raw data into catchy diagrams in
a drag and drop way which facilitates
information analyzing and eliminates the
need for the help of IT department and
patent building
next high performance apart from its
high visualization functionality users
rates its overall performance as robust
and reliable the tool also operates fast
on big data which makes it powerful
performance on an important point on the
list of the advantages of Tableau and
next is the mobile friendliness one of
our best advantages are the Cavalier
benefits is its efficient mobile
application which is available for both
IOS and Android it adds Mobility to
table users and allows them to keep
statistics at their fingertips as well
as supports their functionality that
desktop and online versions have
and finally we have a thriving community
and Forum W has a rich Community the
number of w fans who invest their
expertise and skills in the community is
increasing rapidly business users can
beef up their knowledge on data
processing and Reporting and get many
useful insights in this community also
Forum visitors are ready to help settle
any user issues and also share their
experience
next up we have the disadvantages of
tableau
the first major disadvantage is the high
cost the Tableau is not the most
expensive visualization software
especially compared to such business
intelligence Giants such as oracles and
IBM Solutions all the same the license
is quite costly for small and medium
companies which makes it one of the
considerable fabulous disadvantages
next is the inflexible pricing W sales
team is not flexible enough to provide
case-by-case approach for their
customers ignoring the fact that each
company has its own a unique
requirements for visualization tool
package the W sales model requires
clients to purchase and extends license
from the start
as a result a lot of companies that use
W arrive at the conclusion that they
don't need all their license features
they would prefer to buying a set of
requirements and scale them if necessary
followed by that the next disadvantage
is poor after sales support on multiple
message boards users complain that W
software lacks proper after sales
maintenance if customer has software
performance problem the support team
does not settle the matter by
investigating the problems root and
eliminating it next we have the power bi
capability or the poor business
intelligence capability as previously
mentioned the tool provides
best-in-class information visual
interpretation however it lacks the
functionality required for a fully
fledged business intelligence tool such
as large scale reporting the building of
data tables and statistic layouts and
lastly the poor versioning only the
recent Tableau version support revision
history while for the older ones
software rolling back is impossible now
with the advantages and disadvantages
discussed let's move into the top
companies hiring the companies which are
desperately looking for Tableau experts
are Accenture ey PepsiCo Deloitte Wells
Fargo capgemini and many more
now let's discuss the humongous and
handsome salaries offered by this Tech
Giants
so according to Glassdoor the average
salary of a tableau expert in America is
82 000 grants and for a beginner it is
somewhere around sixty thousand dollars
per annum and at the highest rate it is
1 lakh ten thousand dollars per annum
similarly the average salary of a
tableau expert in India is 5 lakhs 6000
per annum and for a beginner it is
somewhere around Three lakh Sixty
thousand and and for a highly skilled
experienced Tableau expert the salaries
range from 8 lakh 75 000 per annum
simply learns post graduate program in
data analytics from the Purdue
University in collaboration with IBM
should be the right choice for more
details on this program please use the
link in the description box below in
today's session we are going to take
example of the Netflix database which we
have and we will prepare certain reports
in order to identify what kind of
reports we can generate from such a data
set
So currently on my screen what you can
see is the Tableau the Netflix data
sheets the data sources where you have
the Netflix shows movies their
Associated duration uh what kind of
shows or movies are there their release
here are the associated rating
description and a key which is the show
ID now this is the unique identifier for
each show in this Netflix title sheet
and with this show ID all other sheets
are related like you know who are the
directors of the show in which country
the show was released what is the cost
of each show all that information is in
this sheet and to which particular
category basically the listed in
category is being listed in this
particular sheets so what we're going to
do is first we are going to import this
sheet into tableau
okay and then create relationship
between them using the Tableau
relationship canvas so first our the
primary transaction table the sheet in
which all the information related to
movies is there or shows is there is in
Netflix titles and then we will drag
sheet like Netflix cast titles cast now
W has automatically identified the
relationship between the show ID of
titles and show ID of titles cast and it
has made a join
so if you double click this
you can see this relationship
cardinality and the related fields
similarly I'll drag
titles category
countries and directors
Now by virtue of this all the sheets
have now been joined with Netflix titles
and with this relationship ready we can
start preparing our reports
now let's create a basic report where we
can just glance the data like you know
whatever we were seeing in the Excel how
it looks in w
so you have all the types of movies then
for example I drag the release Here
now first I do not want to consider it
as a
Dimension so I'll just
release Here per category per type there
is a release Here
and then I'll drop the listed in
so now these are the categories so per
year the details of the categories right
and then you can
drag the title and the associated rating
so this is just a view of your data
we can name it as shows listing report
now let's try to create some report for
some
measures some numbers
Etc
so now let's
check in which country how many movies
or titles were released you know what is
the count
so first let's drag the
country
so as soon as we dragged the country uh
field it is identified that it has the
geographical names and identified the
latitude and longitude details so
Tableau internally does that
automatically and it has identified the
spots across the globe of the relevant
country
now let's drag the listed in on the
color section
now what it is doing is it is showing in
which country what different kind of
uh category wise movies are or shows
have been released like in Sri Lanka
documentaries have been released in
India action and adventure United States
action and adventure like this
now let's
put
account of
the titles right so if you see 247
action adventure movies or shows have
been released in United States
okay so this is one inference by this
particular report you can
identify
so let's save this report as
listed
in
by country
okay now let's create another report
we will call it as the per year
statistical report in this first I'll
put the release years in the column
now
count of Netflix titles so this is the
count of Netflix titles per year 2017
2016 14. and then
count of Netflix titles in the countries
this is the second bar chart okay now
what I'll do is I'll combine it into one
so one report
we are
moving in the bar creating the bar and
one in the line now I just have to
so we will click on the count of Netflix
titles by country right click Market
dual access so now as soon as you click
click this both the charts have been
combined and right click over here and
say synchronize access
okay
okay so now if you can see see right in
2017 you had uh 2 303 Netflix releases
across all categories and one one five
nine
titles right one zero six three titles
in 2017. so this is a descending
representation of the count of titles
release per year across category and
across titles
so let's call this as
per year
stats
now let's create another report
number of shows
per title okay
so or or sorry per rating so we will
drag the rating column
and
we will
count of titles
and
unique count of titles and unique count
of show IDs
okay
one is bar and one is line
okay
so this is a report which shows rating
wise titles and the show IDs
so in the tooltip you can see the
listing count of Titus and show ID per
rating
okay so let's call it
shows
per rating
now let's create another sheet call it
as
shows
by caste
so in this
what we're going to do is first drag the
cast column on the rows section you have
name all of all the cast and then we
drag the
show ID on the column section and put a
count D and sort it okay
you can remove the null cast and this is
your
sorted order and on the labels section
you can say show Mark labels and you
will see the count return upon care has
done the maximum then on Shahrukh Khan
om Puri nasruddin sha so this is the
details on this sorted order that who
has done how many shows okay
then next is
shows by director similar to shows by
cast
drag
director into rows
or differently if you want to prepare
into columns and then count off
show ID
okay sort it
and you can actually filter out the null
director value
and this is the account put the label
so you can see Jan's Twitter has the
maximum shows
okay
then create another report
shows by category
now similarly drag the listed in
in the rows and show ID count
remove the null category
and sort
labels show Mark labels so International
movies are the highest category dramas
the next comedy International TV shows
this way
you have your category
now let's create a dashboard in which we
want to bring combine all these reports
and
take a common view so first let's drag
listed in by country
then
shows by director
also please let's set the size as
automatic
then let's drag shows by category
and shows by cast
now these four reports are on a single
dashboard we will link them to each
other so go to worksheet actions
add action
filter
select dashboard one
only select shows by category here
and in Target dashboard one
except shows by category keep everything
else
and in the source sheet just select
click select
click ok
now whatever category you will select
over here
that related category data will
automatically be shown in other reports
like see International movies across the
globe across countries directors of only
International movies who has done the
maximum
Johnny Tow and uh shows by cast right
that who has done the maximum
International movies or dramas
or comedies
travel has a maximum number of comedies
and then if you see the comedy movies uh
you know these are the count of comedy
movies released across the countries and
the who is the director
another a very interesting report which
you can prepare is that for example you
want to check in which country maximum
duration of
uh your
maximum duration of
movies have been released so
first let's create a measure
remove this
okay
so if you see
maximum duration of the movies or the
entire Netflix content is maximum United
States then in India these many minutes
next is United Kingdom and you can also
change the colors
whatever you feel is as per your
standards or as per the convention you
can change the color combination
so there are multiple ways you can
generate reports and uh hope you have
understood how you can leverage such a
data to create your reports with that we
have come to an end of this session on
what is data analytics and how to build
real-time interactive dashboards using
Tableau in case if you have any queries
regarding any of the topics covered in
this session or if you feel that you
require the resources used in the
session like the data set code
documentation PPT Etc do let us know in
