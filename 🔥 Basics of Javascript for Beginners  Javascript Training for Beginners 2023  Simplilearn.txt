become a successful web developer then
this course by Caltech ctme is the right
choice for you let's take a minute to
hear from our Learners who have
experienced massive success in their
careers
learning is growing and we not only
decided to grow together in life but
learn and succeed together as well I
successful switched my career to full
stack Java domain with a 15 salary hike
and I was able to grab new opportunities
in my current organization and also
receive a 10 salary hike hey I am
swamijit Basu I am a senior QA engineer
at Encore Inc and I am show me and I
work as a senior quality Analyst at
doodleblue Innovation we started our
upscaling journey together which simply
learned and certainly we made the right
choice after our marriage I had to
relocate to Bangalore and take a year
Gap after working 45 years but I decided
to restart my career again and make a
switch to software domain so I enrolled
myself in full stack Java developer
program from Simply learn seeing my
wife's passion for learning every day
inspired me to take up a course on
simply learn as well I've always been
passionate about technology and learning
devops was always in my bucket list when
I saw simply learns collaboration with
Caltech ctme I decided to take a course
on PG devops after course I not only
switched my career to full stack Java
development with a 15 increment in the
salary but
so I can
software domain and being the new mom
that's the best thing one could ask for
to spend time with little one during
these early years
for me learning devops was fun and
fulfilling at the same time earlier I
had to rely on others at work but after
upskilling myself I single-handedly can
set up the entire blueprint on my code
base alone and get the desired output
and because of that I could grab new
projects in my organization with a 10
percent salary high we enrolled to
upscale ourselves when we were
ex the first child so upskilling Journey
with learn would be undoubtedly very
special to both of us while doing the
course we did come across a lot of
challenges due to the pregnancy but my
wife showed me was a great inspiration
for me as she was handling it all
together and she kept motivating and
inspiring me all the way moreover the
recorded classes and the weekend class
helped us maintain the balance between
work and learning apart from work we
love to spend time with our little one
learning with simply Learned was quite a
fulfilling experience for both of us we
believe that growth doesn't happen
overnight rather it's a journey of
several small steps and upskilling is
one of them now let's discuss the agenda
for today's video we'll start this video
with an introduction to JavaScript where
we'll let you know about what JavaScript
is and how it came into existence
following that we'll cover the basics of
JavaScript like the document object
model JavaScript statements and comments
variables and data types in JavaScript
type conversion in JavaScript operators
in JavaScript JavaScript control
statements and Loops arrays and objects
in JavaScript and JavaScript functions
it is rightly said that you can Master
any programming language by creating
projects so towards the end of this
video we'll create two different games
with the help of HTML CSS and JavaScript
so without any further delay let's get
started JavaScript was developed in the
year 1995 by a person named Brendan Ike
Brandon was working for Netscape
Communications while he developed
JavaScript in 10 days
there were a few changes in the name of
JavaScript initially it was mocha which
was later changed to livescript and then
it finally became JavaScript the start
of JavaScript wasn't that good as so
many developers who were using Java at
that time
they considered JavaScript as a language
for designers and non-engineers no one
ever knew that this small side scripting
language would have a great future today
more than 90 percent of the websites out
there they are using JavaScript somehow
many of you guys gets confused with Java
and JavaScript let me clear it for you
that both Java and JavaScript they are
different languages they have almost
nothing in common many people say that
JavaScript was named after Java as a
part of a marketing strategy to gain
wider acceptance and recognition in 1995
Java was a buzzword when JavaScript was
developed that's why they renamed
JavaScript after Java let's move on to
what is Javascript
have you guys ever been through a
website where you can see images that
slides automatically one such website is
Amazon the home page of Amazon where we
can see different types of ongoing sales
is an example of JavaScript
in Layman language JavaScript is a
lightweight scripting language used to
make web pages more interactive and more
likely earlier when JavaScript was
developed it was only a side scripting
language to do basic tasks like you can
add pop-ups in your web page or you can
make your web page more interactive
nothing more than that but now the whole
scenario has changed with the help of
JavaScript we can create applications as
well
if we talk about applications let's take
an example let's suppose we want to
create an app we can create it in
Android or in iOS but we have to learn
few different languages to create those
apps for Android we have to learn Java
and XML and Swift We have to learn for
iOS but with the help of JavaScript you
can create hybrid applications which can
work on any platform without any problem
Tech giants like Google PayPal Amazon
and YouTube they are using JavaScript
these days the evolution of JavaScript
in the past few years was unbelievable
suppose you want to create a single page
website every one of us is familiar with
Gmail let's suppose so Gmail is a single
page website which looks more like
desktop software than a website so Gmail
is based on angular.js it is a popular
framework by Google which is free of
cost and it is totally based on
JavaScript now let's go over some of the
features of JavaScript these features
are actually why it is considered that
using JavaScript is advantages over
other languages
so let's start some of these points
JavaScript is not a proper programming
language indeed it is a scripting
language
which works in the runtime environment
just like python so there are few other
languages like C plus plus and Java they
need a compiler to work but with
JavaScript you don't need a compiler
once you are done with the script it
will interpret and show you the output
in the browser directly next up is light
weighted JavaScript can provide
programming facility to some extent in
JavaScript you don't need to specify any
data type or return type which helps in
making development more quicker that's
why it is known as light weighted
JavaScript is both client-side as well
as server side technology client-side
technology runs on the user's computer
whereas the server side technology runs
on the web browser initially when
JavaScript was introduced it was
introduced as a client-side technology
but with the introduction of node.js in
2009 one can now work in the back end as
well
there is a way to validate the user's
Data before sending it to the web server
and we can do that with the help of
JavaScript the data will be checked for
correct form and value
all we have to do is start a loop give
it the condition
to check the data JavaScript is also
platform independent although originally
designed to work on browsers only but
now it is a platform independent
language which means once you are done
with the script you can use it on any
browser or platform without any problem
JavaScript is an object based scripting
language although many programmers do
not consider JavaScript as a true object
oriented programming language due to its
lack of class concept
it does support other features of object
oriented programming like it supports
encapsulation it supports polymorphism
and also it supports prototypal
inheritance the last but not the least
feature of JavaScript is case sensitive
so when it comes to keywords identifiers
names and functions JavaScript
differentiates between capital and
lowercase letters we have to keep this
in mind while programming
now I will quickly go over some of the
JavaScript applications where JavaScript
is currently being implemented first one
that comes to every person's mind is web
development it was also the main motive
behind developing JavaScript we have
Technologies like angular we have
node.js we can create beautiful web
pages also JavaScript can be used along
with HTML and CSS to make those static
looking web pages more engaging if we
talk about other applications of
JavaScript we can use it in app
development either mobile app or web app
like we took the example before that how
hybrid apps made with the help of
JavaScript can take over traditional
Android and iOS app one of the most
important and unique application of
JavaScript is in smart watches the
bangle.js is an open sourced Smartwatch
powered by JavaScript Gordon Williams
the man who is currently working on this
project it is said that this new open
sourced stack built around JavaScript
will replace the onboard firmware soon
the next application of JavaScript is
client-side validation as we discussed
earlier JavaScript is used to validate
the user data whether the user's input
is correct or Not by cross checking it
with the given condition like the user
wants to enter in your website and you
want it to be a user with at the rate
gmail.com in his email ID so you will
give that condition to JavaScript and it
will cross check it with the user's
information like when the user will try
to enter in your website it will check
that if at the rate gmail.com is there
or not in the user's email ID
so it can validate the user also apart
from that one more application of
JavaScript is game development
JavaScript can be used to make fully
fledged 2D or 3D games using different
libraries although most JavaScript game
development focuses on creating games
used in browsers only
till now we have an idea about what
JavaScript is its features and its
applications so if you want to learn
JavaScript you need to do some basic
things to make your learning experience
more smoother let's take a look at the
prerequisites to use JavaScript the
first one is the basic knowledge of HTML
and CSS to use JavaScript along with
HTML and CSS you first need to know how
HTML and CSS Works see HTML is used to
create the structure of a web page while
CSS is used to style that web page in
order to use these two with JavaScript
you need to have the basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS because if you want to
learn a new language first of all you
need to know why to use that technology
and to learn JavaScript more efficiently
you need to have the basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS it's better to have a web
browser that supports JavaScript like
Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox or you
can use Safari as well if you are using
a MacBook you will need an operating
system like Windows Linux or Mac
operating system to learn JavaScript a
computer with minimum 512 MB of ram
would be enough for you to start
learning JavaScript but I will recommend
you a computer with 1GB of Ram or 4GB of
RAM for a better experience you can use
any text editor you have notepad which
is free and is already available for
Windows if you don't want to use notepad
you can use other free softwares like
sublime or you can use visual code in
this particular course we will be using
visual code and I'll tell you how to
install visual code and what are the
features of visual code also suppose you
do not have any prior knowledge about
JavaScript don't worry about it we will
take you through the whole course and we
will ensure that you can understand
JavaScript if you want to master the
field of web development then the
postgraduate program in full stack web
development in collaboration with
Caltech ctme can help you accelerate
your career as a software developer in
just few months you'll learn more
encoding techniques with bootcamp level
intensity and gain all you need to be a
full stack technologist this program
will give you the foundation for
building full stack web apps using Java
you will begin with the basics of
JavaScript and then Venture into some of
the more advanced concepts like angular
spring boot hibernate jsps and MVC now
is the perfect time to get started on
your career as a full stack web
developer so what else can you expect
from this course this program includes
caltex ctme postgraduate certificate
your attend master classes from caltex
etma instructors simply learns job
assist will help you get noticed by top
hiring companies so if you want to
become a successful web developer then
this course by Caltech ctme is the right
choice for you JavaScript is the only
programming language that a browser can
understand 25 years ago when developers
were thinking about a language that a
browser can understand
there were a few languages that were
present in the Market at that time just
like Java still there were some problems
with these languages that these
languages need a server to work with the
browser JavaScript on the other hand can
work directly with the browser you write
the code in the editor the browser will
go through it it will interpret it and
then runs the program
the popularity of JavaScript increased
with time
being a language which can do so many
tasks whether it be designing a
website's front end or going through any
website's backend JavaScript can do
anything by the end of 2018 over 95
percent of the internet was powered by
JavaScript means almost every website
out there is using JavaScript in some
way or another
do you guys know about stack Overflow
website for every programmer don't worry
you'll get to know about it once you
start with the programming part stack
Overflow states that JavaScript is the
most popular programming language used
by the developers let me quickly run you
through the reasons why one should learn
JavaScript and then we'll briefly
elaborate each of these reasons
JavaScript has the most powerful
Frameworks JavaScript is constantly
growing and is a well-paid job
JavaScript is beginner friendly and it
has the largest community
JavaScript provides wide range of usage
as well let's move on further and see
why each of these reason is important
JavaScript has the most powerful
Frameworks for every task a user wants
to do like for designing a single page
website like you want to design a
website like Gmail you can use
angular.js if you want to design UI
components or user interfaces for single
page application you have react.js you
want to develop a mobile or a desktop
application let's suppose you have
view.js for that as well basically you
can do anything with powerful JavaScript
Frameworks next up is constant truth one
of the main reasons behind one should
learn JavaScript JavaScript is one of
the fastest growing languages and stands
among the top 10 languages used by the
developers with so much increase in
Mobile Market mobile web development has
seen an immense rise in need of
interactivity
which is Possible only with the help of
JavaScript that's why JavaScript is
continuously growing and there is no way
that JavaScript will go down shortly
the developers working in JavaScript are
well paid across the world anyone who
wants to be a web designer or a web
developer needs to learn JavaScript it
is a must have skill for being a good
web developer we will discuss it in
JavaScript jobs section
JavaScript is an easy to learn language
compared to many other programming
languages like Java Python and PHP
JavaScript provides easy entry points to
the world of programming the best thing
about JavaScript is that it comes
pre-installed on almost every web
browser so you don't need to set up any
environment to start development in
JavaScript which means you can start
coding right away JavaScript has the
largest community among all the
programming languages out there
Community size does matter when it comes
to programming language because the
larger the community size is the more
help you would be likely to get
currently JavaScript has the biggest
stack Overflow Community it has
overtaken Java in terms of community
size and is still growing at a rapid
Pace wide range of usage in my opinion
one of the most important reasons why
one should learn JavaScript by knowing
JavaScript you can build an entire
website from its backend to the front
apart from that you can also build a
full slash mobile application for the
backend you don't need to learn other
programming languages node.js is enough
with a bit of knowledge about database
and apis there is nothing you can't do
with JavaScript when it comes to website
development
let's move on and discuss few jobs you
can take up after learning JavaScript
and we'll also discuss their average
salaries in USA and in India
so the first one is a full stack
developer a full stack developer is one
of the highest paid jobs in web
development sector a full stack
developer is equally proficient in
client-side as well as server side
development a full stack developer earns
around 9 lakh per annum which is quite a
decent amount of money for a person
living in India but if you are a full
stack developer in US you can earn up to
hundred thousand dollars per annum which
is a huge amount
front-end developer is the one who deals
with the front end of any website or
application it's obvious that a
front-end developer will not earn as
much as a full stack developer but the
amount of money a front-end developer
earns in a year is decent a JavaScript
developer works on the front end and
sometimes backend also a JavaScript
developer may be responsible for the
whole website or just a few aspects or
pages of different websites they earn
quite well when it comes to salary a JS
developer in US earns around 75 000 per
annum which when converted to Indian
rupees sums around 55 lakhs approx which
is a huge amount
designing a UI is an interesting job as
it needs creativity along with skills
it's always fun to design interfaces to
attract users one should need a lot of
creativity for this job the amount of
money a UI ux designer earns in India is
around 7 lakh per annum but it can go up
as much as 20 lakh per annum depends
upon the skills possessed and creativity
of the designer so choose your career
wisely if you want to master the field
of web development then the postgraduate
program in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with boot
camp level intensity and gain all you
need to be a full stack technologist
this program will give you the
foundation for building full stack web
apps using Java you will begin with the
basics of JavaScript and then Venture
into some of the more advanced concepts
like angular spring boot hibernate jsps
and MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer so what else can you
expect from this course this program
includes caltex ctme postgraduate
certificate you'll attend master classes
from Caltech ctm instructors simply
learns job assist will help you get
noticed by top hiring companies so if
you want to become a successful web
developer then this course by caltex
atme is the right choice for you Dom
stands for document object model it is
an API for HTML and XML documents which
helps JavaScript to understand what is
their return inside the HTML document
API stands for application programming
interface to understand API better let's
take an example of a restaurant
imagine yourself in the restaurant you
are sitting at the table with the menu
the chef in the kitchen is also part of
the system the waiter here works as a
messenger between you and the chef
that's what API does it works as a
moderator between JavaScript and the
HTML document
Dom defines the hold HTML document in a
hierarchical form to make it
understandable for JavaScript so that
other JavaScript functions can work over
it it represents the entire document in
the form of object and nodes
whether it be elements or text or
anything stored in the document the
entire page content can be accessed or
manipulated by JavaScript Dom is not
used with JavaScript only other
languages like python also uses dom dom
was designed to be used independently to
begin with dom there is nothing special
you have to do different browsers have
different implementation of the document
object model every browser uses Dom to
make the web page of the document
accessible by JavaScript let's move on
and see what is document object model
with the help of an example I believe
you guys have the basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS a prerequisite for this
course let's start things off with a
basic HTML example here we have a code
that consists tags like HTML head body
heading tag Etc we have the HTML tag
here the opening HTML tag and the
closing HTML tag inside the HTML tag we
have the head tag which contains the
documents header part inside the
headtech there is a title tag that
contains the title of the web page then
comes the body tag which contains a
heading tag and two div tags with IDs as
div 1 and div2 a div tag defines a
particular section in the HTML document
the ID used within the div tag it is an
attribute basically that has to be
unique within the document to make the
element unique from other elements next
up we have a paragraph tag with a class
attribute within it CSS and JavaScript
uses classes to select and access
specific elements don't worry guys if
you have no idea about it let us first
see the output of this code before going
to the document object model of this
whole document so guys this is the
output of the previous code we just came
through here we can see the title of the
web page as well as heading after it
there were two different div tags used
in the code here is the output of both
the div tags the question here is where
are those ID and class attributes seen
in the output the answer to this
question is there is nothing on this web
page that can show both of them we can
use them in our CSS file or through
JavaScript to specify the containers in
which they are used so we have concluded
how a normal document works and how the
browser interprets the HTML cool but how
JavaScript uses this code is a bit
different that's where Dom comes into
play when the actual HTML document is
loaded in the browser another
representation of that document is
created known as document object model
here's the model you can see on your
screen
each of the tags used in HTML document
is correspondingly represented as object
in the doll next starting from the HTML
tag and covering all the other tags like
head title body and View mode the same
hierarchy as there was in the HTML
document goes with the document object
model also document to object model is
simply the same HTML document with
different representation the reason
behind this different representation is
that it's easy for JavaScript to
interpret this format JavaScript can't
understand tags but it can understand
these objects JavaScript can easily
manipulate these objects using different
functions which we will see in future
while working on these function for
example if you want to access the text
present inside the heading tag you can
do it by accessing The Heading tag with
JavaScript you can also work on the
style of this text with the help of
JavaScript as well JavaScript uses the
concept of nodes it can access nodes of
the document object model there are many
types of nodes present in the Dom the
basic three types are element node
attribute node and text node the element
node consists of all the tags used in
HTML document like the head tag and the
body tag the attribute node contains the
attributes used in HTML document by now
I hope you have understood the concept
of attributes so JavaScript can access
these attributes as well and the user
can work upon them as per requirements
the text here in the HTML document that
is simply it can also be accessed with
the help of JavaScript it is the value
of that particular element if you want
to master the field of web development
then the postgraduate program in full
stack web development in collaboration
with Caltech ctme can help you
accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with boot
camp level intensity and gain all you
need to be a full stack technologist

basics of JavaScript and then Venture
into some of the more advanced concepts
like angular spring boot hibernate gsps
and MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer so what else can you
expect from this course this program
includes Caltech ctme postgraduate
certificate you'll attend master classes
from Caltech ctm instructors simply
learns job assist will help you get
noticed by top hiring companies so if
you want to become a successful web
developer then this course by Caltech
ctme is the right choice for you before
installing vs code let's discuss a few
things about what is an IDE
so IDE stands for integrated development
environment it is a software application
basically it comprehends facilities to a
programmer for software development just
like photoshops makes it easier for us
to edit photos in the same way IDE makes
it easier for a programmer to write code
if you want to write code IDE will help
you write that and it will help you in
software development
there are a number of Ides present in
the market today we have Sublime we have
pycharm we have comodo we have notepad
and notepad plus plus as well but in
this particular course we will be using
visual studio code or vs code we can say
so let me run you through some of the
advantages that why we are using vs code
for this course so first of all vs code
is free to use as it is a open source
software so you can use it without any
cost
it supports multiple programming
languages there is nothing like you need
any web support or work on different
editors for different programming you
can use vs code for different languages
extensions are also one of the main
reasons behind using vs code see
you want to work on a programming
language it does not support all you
have to do is add an extension search
for it and you are good to go it will
also not affect the speed of the editor
as it runs as a different process it can
also detect code snippet whether it is
complete or not like you are using a
variable in your program and you forgot
to declare it vs code will do it for you
this property is known as intellisense
besides all these properties one main
key feature behind using vs code is it
is cross platform it is available for
Mac it is available for Linux and
windows as well I think there are enough
features we have discussed till now
there are many more features we will
discuss them while installing or while
working in vs code so for now let's move
on to the installation process the
installation process for vs code is
pretty simple just go to Google and
search for vs code
the next page which will open here you
can see that the first link available is
from their official website click on
that and you will go to their official
website here in the front you can see
the download this you can download this
table version from here only or if you
want to download it for you according to
your PC's specifications you can click
on the download button present at the
top right corner of your screen here you
can see that vs code is available for
different platforms it is available for
Windows for Linux and for Mac as well
you can download it from here as well so
if you want to download it for Windows
you can click here it will take you to
another page and it will start
downloading vs once the download
completes open the setup file from your
downloads and it will take you to the
license agreement page you have to agree
with all the terms and conditions you
can go through the full license but then
it will take a lot of time to go through
all this once you click on it this
window will open where you have to
select the location you want your vs
code to locate any ID you install the
default location for all the editors is
the same you can click on browse and
select any other location if you want
but for now I'll be leaving it as it is
and I'll click on next now this will
open and you will click next from here
now it will ask you some questions like
if you want to create a desktop icon or
not select all of them and click on next
now click on install and it will install
vs code for you sit back and relax it
will take time so once you are done with
the installation process click on finish
and the visual studio code will start
automatically
so here we are you can see that we are
on the welcome page so let's start with
these icon present on the left side of
the editor this icon here is Explorer so
vs code works with the folders in your
system click on open folder
and just search any folder or you can
take any folder of your choice so here
in my PC I'll go to work and I'll
take JavaScript as my folder I'll select
it and see it will open the folder and I
already have a few programs written over
here like this
and I have a few more programs like this
and this you can open any program from
that folder by using this Explorer
option you can open any program present
in that folder so basically what it does
any program you make in Visual Studio
code you will save it in this folder
only so it will be easy for you to open
any program anytime next up we have the
search button to find any keyword or
word present in your code whatever you
write here it will show you where it is
present in your code or in your document
so let's suppose I write here simply
learn C it will show you simply learn in
your main screen so you have a shortcut
key for this also press Ctrl F from your
keyboard and write anything here like
it's written simply linear press enter
and it will show you the result the
third option here is for Version Control
if you want to use any Version Control
like you want to use git vs code has
very good integration with Git the next
button here is for debug or it will run
your program once you are done with
writing the code click here and run and
debug just open it with chrome you have
a shortcut for this as well press F5
from your keyboard and it will do the
same the next button here is for
extensions here you can find many
extensions given by the vs code
Community they are free to use for now
we will use these three extensions the
first one is HTML CSS support just click
on the search button write HTML CSS
support the first option click on that
and install that extension similarly you
have to install few modes you have to
install JavaScript and type script
nightly
and you have to install live server in
the same way I'll tell you the use of
live server in the next video when we
will be writing our first hello world
program let me end this video by giving
you a shortcut let's create a new file
here click here create a new file
is
close it create a new file we will name
it as new DOT HTML
so it's new DOT HTML here one thing you
have to keep in mind while saving a file
make sure to save that file with DOT
HTML extension here we are about to
start writing our first program so just
write
exclamation mark and press enter
it will do this see it will write the
basic HTML code which you will need in
almost every program from now on so you
don't have to write this code every time
just do it this way and start writing
main program if you want to master the
field of web development then the
postgraduate program in full stack web
development in collaboration with
Caltech ctme can help you accelerate
your career as a software developer in
just few months you'll learn modern
coding techniques with bootcamp level
intensity and gain all you need to be a
full stack technologist this program
will give you the foundation for
building full stack web apps using Java
you will begin with the basics of
JavaScript and then Venture into some of
the more advanced concepts like angular
spring boot hibernate jsps and MVC now
is the perfect time to get started on
your career as a full stack web
developer so what else can you expect
from this course this program includes
caltex ctme postgraduate certificate
your attend master classes from caltex
etma instructors simply learns job
assist will help you get noticed by top
hiring companies so if you want to
become a successful web developer then
this course by Caltech ctme is the right
choice for you we are using vs code
Studio as a text editor to write the
script here we have already discussed
the benefits as well as the features of
vs code in the previous video so as I
have already mentioned you must have a
web browser with JavaScript enabled in
it so if you are using Google Chrome
it's quite easy to enable JavaScript let
me take you through open Google Chrome
go to settings and just write JavaScript
in the search option go to site settings
and scroll down you will find here
JavaScript allow it if it's not allowed
in my case it's already allowed so I'm
good to go once you have downloaded the
editor and you are done with the
environment setup and all you can start
writing the program so let's go to es
code we will open a new file here and
save it with the name let's open a new
file and we will save it with name
first.html make sure to save your file
with DOT HTML extension as it will make
it easy for the computer to understand
that this particular file is an HTML
file so in the last video we installed
an extension named live server let me
tell you how to use it and what are the
benefits of using live server so let's
write a basic HTML program or just press
the exclamation key and press enter here
we are with the basic HTML program we
have not done anything yet just edit it
a little bit we'll add a heading tag and
inside the heading tag we will write a
heading let's suppose we are writing
hello so now right click on your desktop
and click on open with live server
but this will do it will open your
program in the browser see it's the
basic thing so let me tell you what its
benefits are it will open your program
in the browser and whatever changes you
are making in the programs will be
directly shown in the browser the moment
you save them see just use Google Chrome
or whatever browser you are using and in
the vs code side by side we'll be using
it side by side now let's suppose we'll
change something here let's add a word
here hello
world and the moment we save it it will
be reflected in your browser as well so
that's the benefit of using live server
we'll be using it during our whole code
so now we are done with that let's start
with the program so here we are with a
basic HTML code which has only tags in
it it will print that thing if I remove
this heading tag let me remove and
moment I save it it will print nothing
so guys let me give you a brief
introduction to these tags these HTML
tags are used to render HTML files
properties so that the browser can
differentiate between simple text and
HTML tags you can use as many tags
according to your requirements in our
first program we will write a single
line statement over the browser for that
we will need the script tag don't worry
if you don't know much about script Tech
let me tell you briefly about this text
functionality it is used to embed a
client-side script language remember
guys script tag is used to embed
JavaScript with HTML this is where HTML
and JavaScript comes together
it may contain the scripting statements
or Point towards the external script
through the SRC attribute we will see
the srci attribute as well we'll use the
script tag inside the body tag or we can
use it wherever we want to use it like
it's not necessary to use it inside the
body tag only we can use it anywhere in
a program so let's start with this first
let's start the scripted
we are done with it now the script tag
we have to type in attribute
the attribute is the type is it's a text
file
we are done with our script tag to write
on the web page we use a very basic
command the document.write it is a
JavaScript method using which you can
print anything on the browser let's see
what document.write can do let's write
here something
document dot write
and any text you want to write inside it
let's suppose hello world
welcome to
simply code
so guys we are done with this we have
written a text over here hello world
welcome to Simply code let's see what
will happen when we save it
press Ctrl s and the moment you save it
here it will be reflected on your
browser here you can see in our browser
it's written over here hello world
welcome to Simply code we can Define
JavaScript in an external file as well
let's see how we can do this how this
script tag will Point towards an
external Javascript file here what you
have to do you have written script just
before type use an attribute SRC and
give it the source of the file but till
now we don't have any Javascript file so
let's create a file bus name it as
crypt.js remember you have to save it
with DOT JS extension we are done with
it and we are good to go so here we will
write document
dot right
and any text you want to write here
hello world welcome to
simply learn we will save it the moment
we will save it here
there's something wrong I guess
okay we have not given the source code
of that JavaScript so here we have to
give the name of that file it was
script.js
moment we will save it see the text is
changed here initially it was Hello
World welcome to Simply code but now it
is Hello World welcome to Simply learn
this document.write is not interpreted
by the browser that's because this
script tag is now pointing towards an
external Javascript file anything you
will write inside this script tag will
not be considered now so we are done
with this script tag here we now have an
idea of how to embed JavaScript with
HTML and now let's see some of the
features of document.right so let's
suppose you are you have written this
text here let's erase it and see what
else it can do let's give it a task to
add two numbers let's suppose we have
given you nine plus three let's see if
it works see it will give you the output
directly here document.write 9 plus 3 it
will give you at the output as 12.
similarly you will do any mathematical
task any calculation you want to do
let's suppose
7 multiply by
it
you can see here 12 56 Square let's give
it another one 9 multiply 5 minus let's
suppose 3 and save it 3 9 into 5 is 45
and if you minus 3 from 45 you'll get 42
here is the answer for s42 56 is for 7
into 8 7 multiplied by 8 and 12 is for 9
plus 3. so with that we are done with
how to embed with a JavaScript with HTML
let's move on to another Concept in
JavaScript that is console.log console
log is a function in JavaScript that
works the same as document dot right but
it will not print anything in the
browser let's give it a try let's
clear this and suppose we write here
console Dot Lock
and give it a command
save it and see there is nothing printed
on the browser let's write something in
the body tag we'll use a heading tag and
write something here let's go again and
go to body tag we'll use a heading tag
here as well
and write something here let's suppose
we write
play code save it see this is printed on
the browser to open your browser's
console go to browser right click here
and go to inspect element or you can use
Control Plus shift plus I which I
normally do here you can see the console
option see it has many options like
elements consoles horses Network and
many more but for now let's focus on
Console here you can see the text
printed here so what's the point of
doing this whenever we write a code we
usually have many variables and
functions and a lot of these kinds of
things we don't always know what to
expect as the output maybe we expect a
particular result but we might get
something else one way of debugging our
code is that we can pass a value to this
function here only and we can check the
result of that value out of the code
let's add two numbers here so if you
don't understand it basically what we
are doing for now we are writing a small
piece of code like the program is not
that big but later on when we are good
with our script and we'll use JavaScript
as a primary language the size of the
program will go longer and longer so not
every time you are supposed to check the
output of your code by doing that only
so if you are using any variables or you
are using any functions you can check
the output here only if you have to use
that variable in that way or you have to
change something so you will get it here
only that's the use of console.log let's
add two numbers remove it a is equal to
5 and let these value is 8 suppose
okay we are done with these two numbers
and we will what we'll do we will write
console.log
we have given it the command to add a
and b let's see if it works here
see the value of a plus b is 13. you can
see it here in console the value is 13
you can see it here so here we can see
that the output is 13 you can do any
complex calculation here in the console
it will give you the correct answer you
can see here script.js colon food the
number after the column is the line in
script dot JS here in our file we can
see that the console.log command is in
line number four so here it is written
that it is line number four here so if
you click on this
you can see the script.js opened in a
very small window and you can edit it
from here as well so this is not a
random line number to prove this let's
go on to our program and let's move this
to another line see now the console.log
is in line 11. save it and here you can
see this also changed to 11 so let's
make this more complex add another
variable C we'll add another variable
here let suppose we add C here we'll
give it a more complex equation let's
suppose let C equals to
the moment we save it it will give it
the answer oh no we are done with the
equation let's change it here also the
value of
C is
let's see if it works or not press Ctrl
s it's saved and the value of C is seven
let's see if this value is correct or
not the value of a was 5 5 into 3 is 15
15 plus 8 is 23 23 plus 4 is 27. 27 plus
a minus 25 value of a is 5 minus 25 is
minus 20 27 minus 20. the value of C is
7 say it's correct
check it yourself if you can do
something more interesting with this
console.log or you can do something more
interesting with document dot right so
console log allows us to debug our code
and we can use it if we are not sure
about the output in a lengthy program if
you want to master the field of web
development then the postgraduate
program in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with
bootcamp level intensity and gain all
you need to be a full stack technologist
this program will give you the
foundation for building full stack web
apps using Java you will begin with the
basics of JavaScript and then Venture
into some of the more advanced concepts
like angular spring boot hibernate jsps
and MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer so what else can you
expect from this course this program
includes caltex etme postgraduate
certificate you'll attend master classes
from Caltech ctme instructors simply
learns job assist will help you get
noticed by top hiring companies so if
you want to become a successful web
developer then this course by Caltech
ctme is the right choice for you before
moving forward to statements and
comments here to take a note while you
are performing any calculation let me
show you see if you are performing any
calculation let's copy it from here and
paste it here
so yeah if you want to perform and let's
add two numbers like we want to add 45
and
we'll add let's say five
we will save it and here you can see the
answer is 50 here right so if you want
to perform any calculation you have to
write as it is you can't write any
calculation within inverted comma or
double inverted comma let's try this if
you want to write any calculation within
a single inverted comma the moment you
save it it will print it as 45 plus 5.
what the browser will do the browser
will interpret it as text and print it
as it is so there will be no change so
keep that in mind take a note of it and
we are done with it right now so let's
move on to statements in JavaScript so
guys whenever you use any programming
language you give the computer
some instruction to perform any task or
activity that's common in all
programming languages present out there
like you are giving computers a few
instructions to do a particular task
these instruction you are giving to the
computer are known as statements you see
the code written over here this
document.write function is an
instructional statement given to the
computer to write something on the
browser like if you are writing hello
world inside this function it will print
it in the browser as it is and same for
addition subtraction multiplication and
whatever you are writing inside it it
will basically print it on browser like
let's suppose if we write here something
else
let's suppose we write here inside
double
inverted comma
welcome to Simply code we save it we are
basically giving it the instruction to
write this on the browser so what it
will do it will write it as it is on the
browser these are the instructions we
are giving to a machine to perform a
basic task or to perform a certain task
so if you are writing a whole program
for designing a website or for anything
you must be using more than one
statement you will use a lot of
statements in a single program
so all these statements are separated by
semicolons like here you can see after
every statement I have written a
semicolon it's necessary let me show you
an example see we'll remove this
statement and we'll copy this line and
paste it in the next line and write
something else here what we can say this
is our first program we will write like
suppose I have written it I'll give it
the semicolon here the moment I'll save
it see you can see here it's written
that hello world the first statement
statement is interpreted and written
over here then second it come to welcome
to Simply code see here you can see that
I have not written any semicolon but
it's still showing the output
so let me tell you something interesting
so if you remove the semicolon from any
of these statement here it will work
fine which means JavaScript will forgive
you for these small errors you do but
it's always a good practice to put a
semicolon after every statement because
while writing a whole program in future
you will use n number of statements and
let's see what happen if you try to
write more than one statement in a
single line without any semicolon let's
do this thing here write more than one
statement in a single line and I'll save
it see it won't work the moment I put a
semicolon here and save it it will work
fine
so that's why I am saying that it is a
good practice to use semicolon after
each statement
hope you guys are getting this let's
move on to comments so a comment is also
common for almost all programming
languages it's a line in programming
language which do not have any effect on
the output of the program
it stays there in the code but it does
not affect the output by any means a
comment may be a multi-line comment or a
single line comment as well to write a
single line comment we just use double
slash in front of that statement like
here if we see the output is Hello World
welcome to Simply code this is our first
program
so to make this first statement a
comment what we'll do we'll use two
forward slashes in front of it and it
will become a comment so the moment we
will save it this hello world is
disappeared from the output
so this is how to use a single line
command a comments won't affect your
program by any means let's move on to
multi-line commands to write a
multi-line comment you have to use
forward slash along with the asterisk
sign see if you want to make these two
lines as comments to end a comment we
will use asterisk sign with a forward
slash these two statements are comments
now so the moment you will save it
welcome to Simply code is also
disappeared from the output that's how
comment work they won't affect your
programs out but comments are very
useful in programming it's just a note
for the programmers to remember what
they did at that particular part of the
program suppose you write a program see
here the programs are not that large and
the coding is not that much but in
future when you write a program maybe
the program will be of more than 500
lines or more so suppose you write a
program with more than 500 lines and
come back 20 days later so at that time
you can't go through the whole code this
is where comments will help you in
JavaScript it will help you to remember
what you did at that particular part of
the program if you want to master the
field of web development then the
postgraduate program involves
in collaboration with Caltech ctme can
help you accelerate your career as a
software developer so in just few months
you'll learn modern coding techniques
with boot camp level intensity and gain
all you need to be a full stack
technologist this program will give you
the foundation for building full-step
web apps using Java you will begin with
the basics of JavaScript and then
Venture into some of the more advanced
concepts like angular spring boot
hibernate gsps and MVC now is the
perfect time to get started on your
career as a full stack web developer so
what else can you expect from this
course this program includes Caltech
ctme postgraduate certificate you'll
attend master classes from Caltech ctm
instructors simply learns job assist
will help you get noticed by top hiring
companies so if you want to become a
successful web developer then this
course by Caltech ctme is the right
choice for you so variables are named
storage that a program can manipulate as
the name suggests a variable is a value
that can change according to conditions
variables refers to those memory blocks
inside the computer where we can store
information let's suppose you want to
store any value inside your computer so
variable will represent the location of
that value
in simple terms variables are cups with
stuff inside them and you can use that
stuff later again and again according to
the way you want to before the
introduction of es6 or ecmascript we can
say which is the updated version of
JavaScript variables were declared using
a single keyword only which is where
we'll try to declare a few variables
here we'll see how where keyword works
so let's comment this thing first
so let's declare a few variables let's
suppose where a equals to 15 will
declare
where B and the value of B will be 6 we
will declare where
C and the value of C would be a plus b
so here we have defined three variables
a b and c
a is a variable with value 15 stored
inside it and so is B the value of B is
6 but C is a variable that will contain
the value of a plus b let's try to print
this on browser
document dot right
and we will print the value of C
save it and here you can see the value
of C is 21.
that's the correct answer so similarly
you can also print a and b as well let's
print a and b as well here
what we will do we'll copy this line
we'll paste it for a n
will update this here as well
so it won't create any confusion
so here you can see the value of C is 21
the value of a is 15 and the value of B
is 6. it shows the value of all the
three variables we declared but with the
introduction of es6 or ecmascript in
2015 two more ways were introduced to
declare a variable these are let end
const we shall discuss these two terms
in the later part of this session let me
show you how to declare a variable there
are a few things you have to keep in
mind while declaring a variable name
here we have seen we use three variables
a b and c that was an easy task to do
but giving a variable any name like
something other than a single alphabet
so you have to keep a few things in mind
while naming them start them with the
letter underscore or a dollar sign you
can't use any sign except underscore or
dollar so if you are giving a variable
name you can't use any other sign except
the underscore or the dollar sign you
can use these two signs only you can't
use any other sign
you can't use a number in the starting
apart from that let's suppose you want
to give it a name as 9be you can't do
that in JavaScript JavaScript won't
allow you this if you try to save it it
will throw you an error invalid or
unexpected token so you can't do this in
JavaScript there is no limit for the
length of the variable name but you
can't use reserved keywords in a
variable name like let's try to create a
variable with name as class class is a
reserved keyword in JavaScript we'll
save it and see here it throws an error
unexpected token class but you can use a
class with capital c let's save it and
here it will work fine
why it works because JavaScript
variables are case sensitive if we try
to create a variable with same name
Let's see we try to create a variable
with where girl and another variable
will be where girl with capital G this
time JavaScript will treat these two
variables differently these two are
different variables for JavaScript as
JavaScript is case sensitive when it
comes to variables
let's declare a few more variables let's
remove it we'll declare a few more
variable let's comment this part as well
it will declare a few more variables
suppose we declare a variable with
keyword where and we'll name this
variable as bikening where bike name
and press enter
if we leave this variable without
assigning it any value the by default
value will be undefined let's try to
print the value of this variable
right we will try to print the value of
byte name
save it here you can see the value it
shows is undefined so the by default
value of a variable if you do not assign
it any value will be undefined
let's try to give it a value let's
suppose we
try to give bike name
we use equals to operator to assign it a
value cosine let's suppose we'll assign
it Yamaha
semicolon and press Ctrl s to save this
and here you can see the output as
Yamaha you can also assign a value to
the variable during declaration as we
have done in the previous examples here
we have assigned the variables value at
the time of Declaration only let's move
on to let end const so we will discuss
let and Cones but first we will compare
let with where let is also used to
declare a variable just like where is
used but there is a limitation to use
let
is not accessible outside the Block in
which it is declared
so we will use let here only let byte
name equals and we will change this
value as well we'll change it to Hero
let's say save it and here you can see
the output as hero but if we try to put
this code inside a block let's suppose
we put this code inside this block a
pair of curly braces and we will again
try to access document dot right we will
try to access bike name again from here
from outside the block we try to access
this save it and here you can see bike
name is not defined it is an error in
line 18. so what's happening here
basically you can't access a let
variable outside the scope you can't
access it from here but it will work
with where we try to replace let with
where and save it here you can see it
says hero and hero because first it will
interpret this method and then it will
interpret this as well in case of where
due to its limited scope light variables
are used when there is limited use only
like in for Loop or in while loop we
will learn these Loop in future let will
not allow you to redeclare any variable
let's understand this with an example
here's the code as well we have declared
where bike name if you want to master

companies so if you want to become a
successful web developer then this
course by Caltech ctme is the right
choice for you data types is an
essential Concept in every programming
language to work on any variable you
should know its type
it refers to the kind of data which is
being stored inside a variable the type
of variable is holding basically
every programming language has its own
set of data types which is unique in its
own way
we discussed earlier that JavaScript is
a lightweight scripting language because
we don't need to specify any data type
in JavaScript after all all the
variables in JavaScript are Loosely
packed or we can say JavaScript is a
dynamically typed scripting language we
shall discuss these properties later in
this video for now let me tell you about
different data types present in
JavaScript
so JavaScript data types are divided
into two categories primitive data types
and non-primitive data types primitive
data types are stored in stack whereas
non-primitive data types they are stored
in Heap I don't want you to go deep in
these two terms as if you are new to
programming so we'll leave it just keep
one thing in mind that primitive data
types are base data types whereas
non-primitive data types are objects or
we can say they are derived
primitive data types they are further
divided into five categories they are
divided as numbers strings Boolean
undefined and null non-primitive data
types or complex data types we can say
on the other hand they are divided into
two parts arrays and objects we'll have
separate videos on these topics for now
let's discuss primitive data types to
understand primitive data types much
better let's declare a few variable here
let's say we declare where X and give it
the value as 16. we'll declare where Y
and will give it value
we'll declare one more let's say where
flag
and the value will be true
here we can talk about those properties
of JavaScript which I mentioned earlier
JavaScript variables are Loosely packed
and JavaScript is dynamically typed
scripting language these two points
refers to the same thing here you can
see we have defined three variables X we
have defined variable X we have defined
variable Y and flag as well the values
for all three variables is different
from one another
see variable X is holding a value that
is 16 variable Y is holding a value
hello world which is a string so 16 is a
number hello world is a string and
variable flag is holding a value that
refers to a Boolean value in place of
true we can also write false here
so what's happening here here you can
see there is no data type if you are
coming from a C plus plus background or
a Java background this will be a little
bit weird for you guys because in C plus
plus and Java we used to do it like we
will define an integer let let me show
you
so how we will Define integer in C plus
plus or what we'll say we'll use intx
equals to 5
or something like that we already had a
data type for string as well we have
carrying C plus plus but here in
JavaScript we have no data type we are
only using the where keyword that's what
we call as Loosely typed
this line means that you don't have to
define the data type of the variable
what happens in JavaScript is whatever
the type of value you will pass to the
variable the data type will change
accordingly
so you don't need to worry about if you
are passing a number or if you are
passing in string
just relax just when you pass the value
to the variable it will be determined
automatically so these are the three
basic primitive data types present in
JavaScript which are number
Boolean value and string
so let's move on to the next one which
is undefined it will Define a variable p
and we'll leave it as it is so this
variable P has an undefined data type it
means that any variable which is already
declared but has no value inside it it
has an undefined data type
I'll tell you a basic operator the type
of operator
we'll go through the operators in later
videos but just try to understand the
basic need and use it with me for now
this operator will help you know the
type of value a variable is holding see
let's use it here we have declared a
variable P we'll check the type of P so
to use this operator you have to use it
with document dot right now
so we will do document.write and we'll
use two brackets
and inside it will write
type of and whatever like we want to
know the type of variable X let's
suppose we'll write here x
semicolon save it and you can see here
it says number this means that this
variable has a value which is a number
similarly we will check for all the
variables present here we'll check for
every variable we'll check for y will
check for flag and we'll check for p as
well let's copy this and
paste it three time and let's change the
value here from X to Y in this line
and from X to flag here
and here we'll change it to p
so we have done it we'll save it and see
here it says number first variable y it
says it's a string because you know
hello world is a string it's a sequence
of character for variable flag it says
Boolean so it's defined as true or false
and for variable P it's written here
undefined with this we are left with
only one primitive data type the null
data type there's a difference between a
null value and an undefined value
undefined means lack of value whereas
null means the absence of any value
suppose you are using null as the value
for any variable the type of operator
will return this variable as an object
but if you are not giving any value to
this variable you are leaving it after
declaration the type of operator will
return undefined here's an example for
this C we'll declare one more variable
here we'll declare where num let's name
this variable num and we will give it
the value as null we will use
document.write type of and we will check
with the help of type of operator that
what type of value the variable num is
holding so let's give here num
we are good to go press Ctrl s and C
here it says it's an object
so a null value will always be shown as
an object if you want to master the

from this course this program includes
caltex etme postgraduate certificate
your attend master classes from Caltech
ctm instructors simply learns job assist
will help you get noticed by top hiring
companies so if you want to become a
successful web developer then this
course by Caltech ctme is the right
choice for you type conversion as the
name suggests conversion of value from
one to another in the previous video we
declared a few variables we declared
numbers strengths and Boolean as well in
JavaScript you can change the data type
of any variable from one to another you
can change a number to a string or a
string to a number let's see an example
of type conversion let's declare a
variable here
let's suppose we are using a variable
let's say where num equals to and the
value will be 34 and will print it first
and we'll use type of operator to see
the data type of this variable
save it and see here it shows 34 and a
number I've already told you about the
use of console.log in this topic we'll
use console.log just for a change you
can use document.write as well there is
no problem with any method you are using
let's move ahead and we'll declare a few
more variables will declare a string and
a Boolean as well
let's suppose where Str equals to
hello
and we'll print it as well let's copy it
from here and paste it here
and we'll declare one more variable
let's say where Bool equals to
true
let's print these three variables first
see the output is pretty simple we can
see the value and data types as well see
34 is a number hello is a string and
true is a Boolean value
so let's convert this number to a string
first this number 34 this is a number
here right and we'll convert this number
to a string so how to do it that's
pretty simple all you have to do is
write a word here let's write here write
string with a capital s
and put 34 inside a bracket so here we
are done with it save it and see here
you can see 34 which was a number first
and now it's changed to a string
that's how you can change the data type
of any variable let's try to change a
Boolean value to a string now many of
you guys gets confused with Boolean so
Boolean is nothing if something is true
then set it to true and if something is
not true like if it's false then set it
to false see if we talk about a real
life example say if you know how to
drive create a variable drive and set it
to true and if you don't know how to
write set the variable to false that's
pretty simple that's what Boolean is
let's change a Boolean variable to a
string we have to follow the same steps
as we did for numbers what we did we'll
write here string and put true inside
brackets
we are done with it save it and check
the output here you can see the type
change from Boolean to string like
string function we can also change a
string value to a number
so how to do it let's take a variable
let's say where
str1 will take let's say we are giving
it a numeric value let's say eight nine
six eight
and what we'll do we'll write here
console log and will print it basically
str1 and will write here as well
save it and here you can see 8968 is a
string so how to change this string to a
number that's also a simple task all you
have to do is write here number with
capital n and put this value inside
brackets save it and see here you can
see 8968 changed to a number it was a
string earlier and now it's a number so
if it's a number now let's update this
number and we will see if we are adding
something to 8968 the value will change
or not let's update str1 what we'll do
we'll write str1 equals to str1
plus let's add a number say
so the output should be eight nine seven
zero and the type of operator will give
the value as number let's see what's the
output now save it and see here you can
see the output changed to 8970 but if
you add an alphabet or a character in
the value then the output will be
different here we will copy this whole
code
and we'll paste it here
we'll change the value of str1 equals to
str2 and we'll use an alphabet along
with this number let's suppose it's 8968
a so a is in alphabet and what we'll do
we'll comment this line and we'll go
here and change the value str1
here we are done with it save it here
you can see it says n a n it means that
it's not a number it won't treat this
string as a number because it consists
of both numeric value as well as
character
now let's try to convert a Boolean value
to a number in the case of a Boolean
variable the scenario is a bit different
let's try this
let's declare a variable let's say we
are using where
Bool 2. and the value will be true
what we'll do we'll print the value here
here you can see true and the data type
of true is Boolean so let's try to
change this Boolean value to a number
that's pretty simple task write a number
and
put true inside brackets
save it and here you can see it says 1.
in case of Boolean variable the value of
true is 1 and the value of false is zero
remember this guys keep this thing in
mind if you are changing a Boolean
variable to a number then the value of
true will be changed to 1 and the value
of false will be changed to 0.
now let's have a look at percent and
parse float as well after which I'll
tell you one more interesting function
let's move on to pass things first here
I'll declare a variable let's suppose I
am declaring a variable let's say where
and we'll name this variable as number
the value will be a string let's suppose
it's 56.
we will print it console.log
here you can see that the output is
showing 56 is a string so the data type
here is string because I have used here
single inverted comma so it will take 56
as a string
now let's suppose I want to parse this
as an integer or say I want to change it
to a number I can use parsint as well
apart from number if you want to use
number that's fine but apart from number
if you want to use percent you can use
it
let's see what happens if use percent
use percent and put 56 inside a bracket
save it and see here it changed the
string to a number 56 was a string
earlier right and now it's a number just
like percent we have parse float as well
parse float will do the same thing but
what if you are using a decimal number
here let's see if you are using 56.343
save it
what percent will do it will give you
let's change 56 first let's suppose we
are using 65 now save it and see percent
will give you the value as 65 only it
won't show you the value the decimal
value
but if you are using here number or pass
float it will give you the whole numeric
value let's see what happens if you use
number here
number and save it here you can see the
value is
65.343 like number if you are using here
pass float
let's use parse floatio
and we'll change the value here as well
let's suppose it's 72 point
543
save it and see here it will give you
the whole numeric value of the variable
I hope this is clear for you guys
now there is one more function you can
use in numbers which is dot 2 fixed so
this function has by default zero value
let's suppose I am using here we have to
use it here only let's see what happens
if I am using number Dot
to fixed
so inside bracket we are giving it a
value by default the value is zero let's
suppose we are giving it the value as 2.
now save it and what will happen it will
give you the value as 72.54 similarly if
you are using here some other number
let's suppose seven you can see we have
only three digits here after the decimal
we have three digits only that is five
four and three what happens if we run
this program now let's save it and see
it says
543000 so it will show you the value up
to seven decimal points it doesn't
matter if there are available numbers
after decimal point but it will show you
the value instead of 7 you can also give
here 30 let's save it and see it says
6366 and so on hope this is clear for
you guys if you want to master the field

you want to become a successful web
developer then this course by caltex
atme is the right choice for you in any
programming language an operator is a
symbol that makes the computer
understand that it needs to do some
specific tasks
like if you want to perform an addition
between two numbers let's say we want to
perform addition between 4 and 5. so
guys if you see the plus sign here this
is known as the operator and the two
terms which are four and five these two
numbers these are known as the operands
we have different operators for
different purposes like we have Plus for
addition we have minus for subtraction
we have star or asterisk we can say for
multiplication and many more other
operators as well so there are many more
operators present in almost every
programming language which is present
out there like it operators are present
in Java they are present in C plus plus
in C almost every programming language
out there has the concept of operators
it's essential for you to know how and
where to use any operator despite of the
language you are working on one needs to
understand which operators are available
right so in this particular video I'll
take you through the basic types of
operator present in JavaScript I'll let
you know the types and we'll learn about
how to use them and of course I'll take
you through the different categories of
operators present in JavaScript so in
JavaScript there are basically eight
categories into which operators are
divided which are we have arithmetic
operators we have assignment we have
string we have conditional we have
logical bitwise comparison and type of
operator we'll discuss the first three
types in this video that is we'll
discuss the arithmetic operators we'll
discuss the assignment and the string
operators rest we'll talk about in the
following video
first up here is the arithmetic operator
hope you all are aware of the term
arithmetic right
so arithmetic operators perform
mathematical calculations like it
performs addition subtraction
multiplication and division as well
so here are the few operators you can
see on your screen the plus operator
minus asterisk division we have modulus
we have increment we have decrement so
these are the basic arithmetic operator
we'll see each of these operator with an
example so let's move on to the
programming part first so guys I want to
mention one more thing here I want all
of you to make a separate file for each
topic we'll be covering from now on like
for operators you will create a separate
file will create a separate one for
control statements and other topics
we'll cover in future from today so I
want you to create a separate file
because you know in future if you want
to access these topics it will be easy
for you to access those files instead if
you are using a single file for all the
topics it will be quite confusing so
let's start with the arithmetic
operators first let's take two variables
we are in the Javascript file let's take
two variables let's say where x equal
equals to 6
and we'll take another variable let's
say where y equals to
4.
now we'll perform some arithmetic
operations on these two variables we
have already seen the arithmetic
operators present like we have plus
minus we have increment decrement we
have multiplication division so we'll go
through all of these right so let's
start with it here we are done with our
basic three operators which is addition
subtraction and multiplication I have
commented the division because I have
something to tell you about the division
so let's check the output here first
let's save it and see the output is
addition 10 subtraction 2 and
multiplication 24. for addition it added
the two numbers it's six plus four
similarly for subtraction and
multiplication it is 6 minus 4 and it's
6 multiplied by 4.
for division I have left division
because I hope you guys know the
difference between Division and the
modulus operator let's try to use the
modulus operator along with the division
so what we'll do we'll comment these
three and let's remove it from here and
what we'll do we'll paste this here and
we'll use the modulus here so now let's
check the output what it says for
division and modulus see we have divided
6 by 4 division it says it's 1.5 6
divided by 4 that is 1.5 it will show
the quotient here for modulus it's
saying 2 because
in modulus it gives you the remainder
and in division it gives you the
quotient as the answer so keep this
thing in mind guys keep this in mind
always take a note of it so we are done
with division and modulus next up we
have the increment and The decrement
Operators let me show them to you real
quick so what we'll do we'll declare
another variable let's say where Z
equals to 5.
and we'll use the increment operator
here we'll use again document.write
and here we'll let's say we write
increment how to use increment operator
for increment operator you have to use
plus plus whatever variable you have
used so we'll use plus plus Z
and similarly we'll copy this
paste it here and here we'll use
minus minus 4 decrement
and change here as well
so let's see what happens let me give
some space in between them so that you
won't get confused
let's save it and check the output here
increment is it says 6 and decrement it
says 5. so you can see here the
functioning of decrement and increment
operator the increment operator will
increase the value of Z by 1 and the
decrement operator will do the opposite
of this it'll decrease the value by 1.
so we are done with the arithmetic
operators next up we have the assignment
operators
assignment operators are used to assign
values to different JavaScript variables
let's see the types first and then we'll
see how to use them so we have these
assignment operators here here we have
equals to plus equals to minus equals to
and we have multiplied equals 2 we have
divide equals to modulus equals to and a
few more so let's see each of them with
example maybe not each of them but we'll
try to cover almost every single
operator out there which is present in
your screen so let's move on and see
let's move on to the programming part so
here we are guys let's declare a few
variables let's say we are declaring a
variable a and we are giving it the
value as 10 suppose
and we'll declare another one let's say
where B and give it the value
5. so for assignment operators what
assignment operator mean we have used
here the equal to sign right we have
used a equals to 10. this means whatever
value present on the right side of the
operator like here it is 10 it will be
assigned to the variable a
I hope you guys are getting this keep
this in mind so we have the value 10 and
we are assigning this value to the
variable a
it says let's try to check the output of
a let's try to print a on the screen
okay
document
see here you can see that the value of a
it says 10. and similarly the value of B
is 5. so let's do one more thing we'll
assign the value of a to B how to do
this let's change the value here only
let's suppose we are using the value of
where a is 13. okay and the value of
where we will be providing as let's say
a
so now let's try to print the value of B
here we'll change
we'll print the value of B only let's
save it and see the output see it says
the value of B is 13. because we have
assigned B the value present at variable
a which is 13. that's why it is showing
the value of b as 13 this is what
assignment operator is let's try other
assignment operators as well
let's take another variable
so let's say where even
equals to let's say 51.
so the next operator we will be using is
let's update the value of A1 first so
how to do this let's say A1 equals to no
it's a 1 plus equals to 9.
and we'll print the value
let's check the output now
see it says the value of A1 is 60 here
we have given that A1 plus equals to 9
see A1 plus equals to 9 is the same as
if you don't want to write here A1 plus
equals to 9 you can also write it as
even equals to A1
Plus 9. both of these lines are same
both these statements means the same
they are performing the same tasks so A1
equals to A1 Plus 9 is same as a 1 plus
equals to 9. that's what I want you to
understand with assignment operators
similarly if you want to perform a 1
minus equals to you can do it as well so
let's say A1 minus is equal to 5 and
we'll copy this line from here paste it
here again and save it now let's see the
output here what it says some of you
guys may get confused that here it shows
the value of 6 is 69 of A1 so in the
first statement when we try to print A1
here the initial value was 51 then this
statement was performed and the value
was updated to 60. then after that one
more statement this statement is also
performed and the value updated to 69
it's 51 plus 9 plus 9 and the value we
have here is 69. now what happens if we
are using the minus equals to operator
what it will do it will decrease the
value of A1 by 5. it means that a 1
equals to A1 minus 5 the value of A1 is
69 and it will subtract 5 from 69 so
here it says the value of A1 is 64.
hope you guys are getting this so we
have so many operators we have so many
of them like let's try a few more
so we have multiply equals to we have
division equals to we have modulus
equals to so I'll write these and then
we'll see the output
so we are done with it let's check the
output here for A3 A4 and A5 you can see
for A3 we have used multiply equals to
for A4 we have used divide equals to and
for A5 we have used modulus equals to
let's check the output here
save it and see it says the value of
a350
it here we have taken a3s5 it's 10 into
5 because A3 equals to A3 into 5 so it's
10 into 5 it shows the value as 50.
similarly
here it says the value of A4 is 3.75
because we have used your food so
instead of 4 let's try to use 3 and save
it see here you can see it divides it
and gives you the quotient and the value
of A4 divided by 3 is 5.
so
similarly for A5 it shows the value of
A5 is 6.
because we have used the modulus
operator here N20 divided by 7 we have
6s remainder
so I hope you guys are pretty clear with
assignment operators now next up we have
string operators the plus operator which
we used as the arithmetic operators
earlier right it also operates as a
string operator so we can use it to
concatenate two strings that mean we can
add two strings as well in JavaScript it
is possible with the help of string
operator similarly we have plus equals
to operator for Strings as well like we
have plus equal to for assignment it has
the same functioning for string as well
let's take the example for these two
operators let's move on to the
programming part so here you can see we
have two variables where str1 and where
str2 the value of where str1 is hello
and the value of where str2 is full so
what we'll do we will add str1 and str2
so let's check the output here save it
and see here you can see the output as
hello world but there is no space
between hello low end World keep this
point in mind guys so if you are adding
two strings just like this there will be
no space between the two strings so if
you want to add any space between these
two what you have to do you have to
mention it here separately
and this this is the syntax if you want
to add space between your strings so now
let's save it now and see here you can
see there is a space between hello and
world
so this is the use of plus operator in
strings so the next one we have plus
equals to let's take another string
let's take it as whereas tr3 and we'll
give it the value as
welcome
so what we'll do we'll use the plus
equal to operator here str3 plus equals
to
let's say
to
simply code
and
what we'll do we'll print the value of
str3 here
so save it now
so here you can see the value of str3 if
we remove this this line
let's see what happens now
and we'll give it a space here
save it now see here you can see it says
hello world for the first str1 plus str2
it says hello world for str3 it says
welcome to Simply code see here the
space is already given so it will show
this in the output but between welcome
and two if you want to add space you
have to
do the same what you have done for str1
and str2 so let's do it here as well
plus sign yes
save it now and see here you can see it
says welcome to Simply code with proper
space if you want to master the field of

ctme is the right choice for you now we
are left with conditional operators
logical operators we have bitwise
operator and we have comparison and
finally we have the type of operator
so these are the five operators we are
going to cover today
before we start with the operators let
us first discuss associativity
talking about associativity
it refers to the direction in which the
entire expression is evaluated for
example if you have any expression let's
say you have a plus b so the direction
in which this expression will be
evaluated either it will be from left to
right or from right to left so this is
known as associativity let's understand
it with the help of an example
so here you can see I have taken three
variables I have taken variable a and I
have assigned it value as 12. I have
taken variable B and the value assigned
to B is 8 and finally I have a variable
result which stores the value of a plus
b
lastly what I am doing is I am printing
out the result variable inside the H1
tag here you can see I have used the H1
tags and I have used the plus operator
to concatenate the strings right I have
concatenated these two strings along
with the result along with the answer of
result so the plus operator here is
doing two different tasks right here you
can see it is performing the addition of
two numbers right and here you can see
it is used to concatenate two strings so
now let's talk about associativity
because I guess you guys are cleared
with string operator till now we have
discussed them in the previous video
right so let's talk about associativity
now so certain operators have right to
left associativity and certain operators
have left to right associativity
so when I say right to left
associativity in this case the value
present at the right side of the
operator see if you are using any
operator for example here you we have
used the assignment operator right we
have discussed the assignment operator
earlier so here you can see the value
present at the right hand side of the
operator will be assigned to the
variable which is present at the left
hand side of the operator so
it's going this way like first the
computer will check the for the value
present at the right it's going from
right towards the left this is what we
are known as right to left associativity
and assignment operators like equals to
this have right to left associativity
let's add here one more variable let's
say we are adding a variable variable C
and we are giving it the value as
5 and what we'll do we'll update result
as well let me first show you the output
of this particular program see the
output will be value of result is 20 and
high there high there is concatenated
with the string value of result is N20
is the actual answer the 20 is the value
of result so let's add one more variable
here let's say we are adding a variable
C and the value of C will be 5. what we
will do now we will update result as
well here you can see I have done a plus
b plus c
so
save it and here you can see the value
updated to 25 the value of result is
updated right so the plus operator has
associativity from left to right till
now we have talked about right to left
as for assignment operators but for plus
operators the associativity is from left
to right it means it will first perform
a plus b
and then the value of C will be added to
that of a plus b first it will perform
12 plus 8 and then finally it will add 5
to that value so it will be 20 plus 5
and that's why the output here is 25 we
know that JavaScript is a Loosely typed
programming language right which means
that we don't have to specify data types
every time like we are using if we are
using any data type we don't need to
specify it every time like let's do one
thing let's add a string here so what
we'll do we'll add a string let's
suppose I'm adding hello
so practically the answer would be hello
Plus
25 or hello 25 it should be the answer
but let's check the output now save it
and here you can see the output is hello
one two eight five what happened here is
the associativity of the plus operator
is from left to right we know this so it
will start from the left and it will see
that okay the first thing to add is a
string so it will assume that everything
ahead of this will be a string that's
why we have the output as hello 12 8 and
5 so 12 8 and 5 all are acting as string
here
let me clear this one for you with a
little bit of modification now what
we'll do we'll remove this string from
here and we'll add it somewhere else
let's say we are adding it here
so
let's add one more variable to make it
more clear let's say we are using
variable D and the value will be 10.
and what we will do we'll perform a plus
b before the string and then we'll
perform C plus d
right so here you can see when you save
it it says 20 hello 510 so when it
reached out the first variable it finds
out that the first variable is a number
so it added the first two numbers right
it added 12 and 8 the answer is 20 then
it came across this string hello and
then finally it assumed that everything
ahead of this will be a string so that's
the output 20 is the addition of a plus
b and then the string hello and finally
we have the value of c and d as string
so we have the value 5 and 10 not 15
right I hope you guys get this
so let's move on to conditional
operators the conditional operators
assign a value to a variable based on a
certain condition right it contains a
condition and you know for every
condition like there exists only two
possibilities either it can be true or
it can be false there is nothing else
you can do with a conditional operator
so it works the same as if else
statements which we'll cover in further
videos the only difference between if
else and conditional operators that it
takes less time or we can say its usage
is pretty easy
so here is the Syntax for conditional
operators so it seems pretty
straightforward right so here you can
see we have a variable name we have a
condition depending upon the condition
we have two values
here's the example as well C you can see
we have a variable voter next up we have
a condition if age is less than 18 so it
will check for the condition that if the
value of age is actually less than 18
let's suppose the value of age is 15. so
it will check if 15 is less than 18 it's
true then it will print 2 am or if the
value of H is greater than 18 then it
will print false or you can say it will
print old in a few
so let's move on to the programming part
so here you can see I have taken a
variable X and the value assigned to X
is 30. what we'll do in variable y I
have given it a condition so it will
check for X which is 30 if 30 is greater
than or equals to 50.
so if it's true if 30 is actually
greater than 50 then it will print true
else it will print false so we'll check
the output once let's save it and see
here you can see the output as false so
if you update the value of axial let's
suppose we are updating the value of x
let's suppose it's
60 save it now and see the output has
changed to true because 60 is greater
than 50 right also if you want to write
a message here only you can do it write
it here as so we'll copy it from here
we'll copy document.write
and we'll paste it here
let's remove this document.write and we
what we'll do we'll
use this bracket
here
and if any message you want to write
like you want to write value of
so
and now what we'll do will
save it
see it says value of true so or you can
write any other message here as well you
can write value of x is greater than or
you can write whatever
so if you want to update it like value
is and here we will update true
with
greater
and here we will use
smaller
save it now see here it says value is
greater value of x is greater than y
so that's all for conditional operators
also one more thing and conditional
operators has three different parts
right and that's why it is also known as
ternary operator three different parts
as in it has a condition like here it is
it's okay it has a condition and it has
two values right it has true or false so
that's why it is also known as ternary
operator
next up we have the logical operators
so logical operators are used to
determine the logic between two
variables or values we can say we use
logical operators to check whether
multiple conditions are true or false
here on your screen you can see the
three different types of logical
operators present in JavaScript along
with the syntax and example
so the end or note are the three
operators present in JavaScript
the and operator here you can see it it
is holding two values right it it has X
less than 10 and y greater than 1. so
the end operator will return true only
if both the conditions are true like X
has to be less than 10 and Y has to be
greater than one so here you can see we
have taken x equals to 7 and Y equals to
4. so both the conditions are satisfying
here so that's why the output of the and
operator will be true for our operator
the case is a bit different so if any
one of these two conditions like we have
two conditions if any one of these two
is true then the output will be true and
if both are false then only the output
will be false
the north operator on the other hand
will check if x is equals to Y if the
value X is holding is equals to that of
Y if the value is not equal then it will
return true
I hope you are getting this that's a
little bit
confusing but if the value X and Y
holding if they are not equal then it
will return true if they are equal then
it will return false
right
we'll understand the programming concept
of logical operators in further videos
when we learn about control statements
we primarily use logical operators with
the if statement through which we'll
come across in the following video in
the next video we will go through the
control statements so we'll understand
the programming part of logical operator
there only
next up we have the comparison operators
so comparison operators are similar to
logical operators in some way
they are also used to check for true and
false as the name suggests we use
comparison operator to compare two
values or we can say to compare two
variables using different operators
so here you can see on your screen these
are the different types of comparison
operators present in JavaScript we have
equals to we have not equals to we have
equal value and data type we have
greater than less than and we have a few
more so I hope you guys must remember
from the previous video that a single
equals to operator is an assignment
operator so if we are using a single
equals to then it will be considered as
an assignment operator for comparison we
have to use double equal to keep this
thing in mind whenever you are using any
operator in JavaScript or especially the
equals to operator so if you want to
compare two values you have to use
double equals to because single equals 2
is used to assign values this is an
assignment operator so let's move on to
the programming part now
so guys here you can see I have taken a
variable X and the value assigned to X
is 10. this code seems a little bit
longer to you but that's a simple piece
of code like I have used almost every
comparison operator we came across in
the previous slide I have used each one
of them and I've used the document dot
right after every comparison operator to
put some spaces in between so that you
guys don't confuse between them so let's
check the output now see you as you can
see I have used the double equals to the
triple equals to I've used X not equals
to it so let's check the output save it
and see here it says false false true
true true false true false so for x
equals to equals to it it compared the
value 10 with 8. and 10 and 8 are not
equals to so the output will be false as
similar for 10 and we have used the
triple equals to operator which means
equal value and data type so both 10 and
8 have equal data type they both have
the same data type that is number but
the values are different so it will
print false
for X not equals to it it says 10 is not
equals to it yeah 10 is not equals to it
actually so it will print true similarly
for X not equals to equals to it it will
check that both the values are not equal
but the data types are equal right so it
will print true for this as well for X
greater than 8 yeah 10 is greater than 8
so it will print true
similarly for it will check for X
smaller than 8 and it will check for X
greater than equals to it and also for X
less than equals to it
so by now you have understood how
comparison operators work so comparison
operators are the easiest to use in
programming
and that's all for comparison operators
let's move on to the next one we have
the next type of operator we have is the
type of operator you guys have an idea
about the type of operators right as we
have discussed it earlier in case you
haven't watched the previous videos let
me give you a brief introduction about
this type of operator
so the type of operator is used to
provide you with the type of whatever
value you put to the right of it like if
you are using any data type and you want
to know about the data type of a
particular variable let's say so you can
use the type of operator it will tell
you the actual data type of any variable
so in JavaScript as we have discussed
earlier in the video where we have
particularly discussed about the data
types so there are five different types
of primitive data types right we have
the numbers we have strings we have
Boolean we have null and undefined
so let's try to use type of operator
so here you can see I have used four
different variables which are I've used
variable X variable Y and variable flag
and variable P so the values are
different the x is holding 17 why is
holding header and flag has the value as
false and I have defined P but I have
not assigned it any value to law so what
I'll do I have used the type of operator
to find out the type of every variable
like here I have used it for X for y for
flag and for p
let's check the output now
save it and see it says number string
Boolean and undefined see here we have
given X the value as 17 so 17 is a
number then it says it is a number for
hey there it says it is a string for
false it says it is a Boolean value like
in Boolean value we have only two values
like false and true
so for variable P it says undefined
you know there is a difference between
undefined and null data types undefined
means lack of value whereas null means
this absence of value that there is no
value at all
so suppose you are using null as the
value for any variable right the type of
operator will return
object but if you are not giving any
value to any variable like you are using
the variable as it is like here we have
not given it any value so if you are
doing this the type of operator will
return undefined so let's take an
example of null as well let's declare
another variable let's say where ABC
and will give it the value as null
so and finally what we'll do we'll
use type of operator
save it and see here it says the type of
variable ABC is an object
so remember this thing guys
and now we are done with almost 7
operators we had and we are left with
one operator only
so let's move on to our last operator
which is the bitwise operator this
operator doesn't have that much of
practical usage in the real world they
are not definitely useless but this is
something like we are not going to use
on a daily basis so in computers if you
know the numbers are stored in binary
format bitwise operators work on 32-bit
numbers and we have decimal numbers like
we understand decimal numbers computer
works on binary numbers right so when
bitwise operators are used any operand
present in the operation
is first converted to a binary number
and then converted back to a JavaScript
number
so
here you can see on your screen we have
four different bitwise operators we have
the and operator we have or we have node
and we have zor or we can say exclusive
or
the result and the answers are also here
it's pretty simple see we have used the
and operator before as well while we
were in logical operators but the syntax
was different and
here you can see we have a single
Ampersand sign to use bitwise and
operator
so here you can see
how the decimal number first changes to
a binary number suppose we have X as 5
here you can see X is first changed to a
binary number this is the binary
equivalent of 5 and 1 is also changed to
a binary number and finally the result
whatever result we get it is changed to
a decimal number so that's how bitwise
operators work let's take an example of
bitwise operators
so here you can see I have taken two
variables I have taken variable X and
the value of variable X is 5 and another
variable is y and the value of y is 1
and then I have used all the four
bitwise operators like I have used X and
Y I have used X or Y I have used not X
and I have used the xor operator between
X and Y so let's check the output now
here you can see if we talk about the
output see here it says 1 5 minus 6 and
4. so for x and y c
the value of x is 0 1 0 1 and for end
operators it will return 1 if both the
values are 1. if any one of the two
values are 0 then it will return 0. so
what it will return here it will return
0 for 0 0 for 1 0 it will also return 0.
similarly for 0 0 it will also return 0
and for 1 1 it will return 1 which is
the binary equivalent of 1. so the
answer here is 1.
for x or y it will return 1 if any one
of the two values are 1. see if both are
0 it will return 0. if any one of the
two values is 1 it will return one
it will return 0 again and finally it
has two ones so it will return one
and 0 1 0 1 is the binary equivalent of
5 that's why the output here is 5.
for not operator it works a little bit
different it gives you the output which
is same as minus x minus 1 so minus x
minus 1 will be
C minus x minus 1 will be minus 5 minus
1 which is minus 6 so this is a bit
different here the not operator here is
a bit different for xor operator or we
can say exclusive or it will return four
why it will return 4 it will return 1
when any one of the two values is one if
both are one then also it will return
false it will return 1 only in one
condition if any one of the two values
is 1 then only it will return one that's
why the output here
the output here will be 0 1 0 0 that's
why it's written as 4 which is the
binary equivalent of 0 1 0 0. let's
suppose we have a piece of code that is
n number of statements here let's say we
have this code and so the conventional
workflow will be it will first execute
the first statement then second then
third and so on till statement n right
so this is the basic flow right from
statement one till statement n and it
will execute each statement in between
however in real world the scenario is
different like we don't write the code
in same menu every time
for example let's suppose you are in
line 5 and you want to print this line
10 times so what should you do you can
write this line 10 times or you can copy
paste it right okay let's forget about
10 times let's suppose you have to use
this code or we can say let's suppose we
have to print this statement 100 times
doing this like copy pasting it for 100
times or writing this statement for 100
times that's useless and unnecessary
right so that's where control statements
comes into picture we'll discuss them in
a while let's assume another situation
this time you want to make a choice
based on certain conditions you can use
conditional operators but then it has
limitations right to tackle this problem
we have control statements in JavaScript
so these are the very basic reasons why
we need control statements for
performing a certain activity like if we
want to perform a certain activity n
number of times or if you want to make a
certain decision making kind of
scenarios in your program that's where
we need control statements in JavaScript
in JavaScript we have two different
types of control statements depending
upon what action we are performing so we
have the conditional control statements
and we have the iterative or we can say
looping control statements
talking about conditional statements as
the name suggests we use conditional
statements when we have to make
decisions based on conditions when we
have two choices or when we can say when
we have two different conditions and we
want to make choices accordingly so
that's where we use conditional
statements we have two different types
of conditional statements the if else
statements and the switch case
talking about the iterative statements
as the name suggests if you want to
perform any action more than once or
maybe n number of times instead of
writing them again and again
we use loops so Loops are basically
statements we use Loops to perform any
activity n number of times with specific
conditions
so in JavaScript we have four different
type of Loops we have for Loop while
loop do while loop and foreign Loop
so the for Loop while loop and do while
loop you might have heard about them
earlier because they are also present in
other programming languages but this
foreign Loop this is a new type of loop
present in JavaScript we use foreign
loop with objects we'll go through
objects in upcoming videos and of course
we'll be looking at each of these
control statements in detail
will have a particular video for each of
these topics
now let me introduce to you the break
and the continue statement
they are not the types of control
statements but they do assist in other
control statements the break is used to
exit a switch statement or Loop like
when used in a loop it breaks the loop
and continues executing the code after
it
and on the other hand the continue
statement breaks a single iteration when
used in a loop when we use continuous
statement in a loop it breaks a single
iteration and it breaks the iteration
only if the specified condition occurs
and then it will continue with the next
titration in the loop

if else conditional statement is used
whenever we work with condition it can
be either a single condition or maybe
more than one condition or multiple
conditions we can work with
so let's try to write a basic program
with a single condition
so then we'll move on to multiple
conditions using the elsif statement so
we'll create a new file today so I hope
you guys know the importance of creating
a separate file for every topic you know
it will be easy for you to work to find
out that separate file later if you want
to revise that topic so here is the
program where we have taken a variable X
and the value of x is 10. so what we are
doing in this program is we are checking
if the value the variable X is holding
that is value 10 and if the value is
less than
10 or if the value is greater than 10 so
we have only two conditions either the
value can be less than 10 or the value
can be greater than 10 or equals to 10
is
so here in this program what we'll do
we'll first we'll update this value as 8
so the variable X is holding the value
8. so to check the output let's save it
and here you can see it says the value
of x is less than 10. of course the
value 8 is always less than 10 right so
for it that's fine it will say the value
is less than 10 and similarly if we do
the same for let's say 11 save it now
and see it says the value of x is
greater than 10. so that's quite simple
right but what if we are giving the
value as 10. we know 10 is equals to 10
so save it now and see here you can see
it says the value of x is greater than
10.
this is happening because what we did we
as we told The Interpreter to check the
value if the value of x is less than 10.
we didn't mention that if what to do if
the value is equals to 10. so it will
check for only X is less than 10 not for
equals to 10 or greater than 10 so here
what it is doing it is checking if the
value is less than 10 so that it says
okay let's print this statement if the
value is less than 10 or
if the value is not less than 10 or if
the value is equals 2 or greater than 10
it will print the value of x is greater
than 10. to avoid this type of
misunderstanding we use an elsif
statement so the concept of else if
statement is the same as if statement
but we are doing we are using multiple
conditions right we are giving it more
than one condition so how to use else if
it's quite easy and the syntax is also
similar to
the if statement the only difference is
that it contains an else before if so
it's an else if so what we are doing is
we are giving it a condition that else
if x equals to 10.
so now what it will do it will check for
two conditions that if the value X is
holding is less than 10 or equals to 10.
and what we'll do we'll update it as
so let's check the output now
save and see here it says the value of x
is equals to time right so I hope you
guys are getting this the execution flow
for this program will be like it will
check for the first condition if x is
less than 10 if yes it will print the
value of x is less than 10 if no it will
move on the to the following condition
like under the else if statement it
finds a condition that if x is equals to
10 it will check for it if yes if x is
equals to 10 then it will print the
value of x is equals to 10.
or if not then otherwise it will move to
else statement and print the value of x
is greater than 10 we don't need to
specify any particular condition for
this you know because we have already
specified the two conditions that if x
is less than 10 or if x is equals to 10
now we'll take a look at some basic
programs other than this one we'll take
a look at a few more basic programs
so here's the another program what we
are doing here is we are taking a
variable X and the value of x is 5. so
what we are doing is we are checking if
the number is an even number or an odd
number the thing you have to keep in
mind is the logic to find whether a
number is even or an odd number so to
check uh whether a number is even you
what we do we'll divide that number with
two right but basically we want is we
want the remainder as 0 when we use the
modulus operator so what we'll do here
we have written X mod 2 equals to equals
to 0. so if the reminder is 0
then the number will be an even number
because it is divisible by 2 else it
will be an odd number so that's quite
simple right let's save it and check the
output for 5 it says odd number yeah 5
is of course an odd number right so
that's for even and odd number
so here we have with another program
here it says we have a variable Y and
the value of y is
let's say
eat and
what we are doing here is we are
checking if a number is positive or
negative or zero so we have three
different conditions either number can
be positive or it can be a negative
number Any number greater than 0 is a
positive number right and any number
less than zero is a negative number and
the third one is a number zero it's
neither positive non-negative so let's
check for the number eight save it and
see here you can see it is a positive
number let's see for
minus 2 save it now it says a negative
number for 0 it will say 0.
so these two programs are quite simple
guys right the conditions are pretty
simple we use modulus operator we used
greater than or less than sign and
that's quite easy to use right so let's
move on to the next program which is a
bit tricky than these two so what we'll
do in our next program is we'll check if
a number is positive or negative and at
the same time we'll check for even an
odd also
if you are giving any number as input
like let's suppose we are using five
we'll check if the number is positive or
negative and odd or even so we'll do
this simultaneously let's move on to
this program so there are two ways to
check whether the number is positive or
negative and odd or even
so the two methods we'll discuss them
one by one the first one here is
to use nested if and another one is when
we use logical operators along with the
if else if statement so this one here
you can see right in front of your
screen is
the nested if method so here you can see
we have used the if statement we have
given one more condition inside another
if statement so first it will check
whether a number is positive or not for
X greater than 0 it will check if the
number X is greater than 0 then if yes
if it will find it that yes this number
is greater than 0 then it will move on
to the nested if and it will check for
odd or even
for odd number and even number it will
check if it finds that the number is
even it will print that the number is
positive and even
if the number is not even it will print
the number is positive and odd so here
you can see the difference what The
Interpreter is doing is it will check
for the number as positive and if the
number is positive then it will move on
to the nested if and check for the even
or odd so if it finds that the number is
even it will print positive and even
otherwise it will print positive and odd
then it will move on to the next
condition which is for negative number
if x is less than 0 then it will again
move to the nested if and it will check
for even and odd so if it finds that the
number is even it will print negative
and even otherwise it will print
negative and odd and the last condition
is for the number 0. let's
try to find out the output of this and
what we'll do we'll update the value of
x as 8. so save it now here it says the
positive and even so 8 is a positive
number and even as well let's update the
value of x is minus 5.
save it now it says negative and odd
number minus 5 is a negative odd number
right so that's how it will check for
positive
or negative and odd or even so we are
doing both the things simultaneously in
a program we have an alternate method as
well here you can see on your screen we
have written a program and here we have
taken a variable X the functioning of
both the programs is same
both of these program will check for
positive or negative and odd or even
so here you can see I have taken a
variable X let's say the value of x is
7. it will check for X greater than 0
and x mod 2 is equals to equals to zero
so we have four different conditions
right a number is
greater than 0 that means a number is
positive and even a number is positive
and odd a number is negative and even a
number is negative and odd and the final
one is a number is zero okay we have
five conditions and we have to specify
these four conditions here so here we
you can see we are using the logical and
operator this means it will print this
statement let's suppose for this
statement it will print this only if
both the conditions are true right if
the number if the value X is holding is
both greater than 0 and an even number
so if you try to
find out the output now save it and see
here it says number is positive and out
so the number 7 is greater than zero
but the number 7 is not an even number
that's why this line is not there on the
browser it will print this line because
the number is
positive and odd right if you want to

Caltech ctm instructors simply learns

top hiring companies so if you want to
become a successful web developer then
this course by Caltech ctme is the right
choice for you the switch case is
another conditional control statement
and just like the if else control
statement there is a difference between
the usage of if else and switch case
statement
now both if else and switch case works
with conditions and we have to choose
when to use which case over if else
switch case is generally preferred over
the if else when there is n number of
test cases present or we can say when we
are working with a lot of conditions
let's say we are working on a program
and you ask the user for an input
between 50 and 100 a numeric input
basically and in the output we have to
print the textual form of that number
suppose if the user enters 75 right the
output will be like this
so what we are doing we we are taking a
number from the user as an input and we
are printing the textual form of that
number right
so we can use the if else or we can say
else if control statement but the
program will be so lengthy and not so
clean
also switch case is much more efficient
than if else when it comes to execution
time like if we have n number of
conditions then using switch case is a
better option we'll get to know why in a
bit so let's move on to the programming
part and today
we'll write a program where we have to
find the month in a year by accepting
its number so we have 12 months in a
year for example if we enter 4 then the
output will be April and if we enter 8
then the output will be August because
August is the eighth month of the year
right so I hope you guys are clear with
the question of course we can do this
program with the help of if else
statement but we discussed earlier that
using IF else in such cases is not
efficient right we can use which case in
this scenario so let's create a variable
first let's say we are creating a
variable where month and
you can give any value to this variable
from 1 to 12 you can provide it with any
initial value
so let's create a variable first let's
say we are creating a variable where
month and the value we are providing it
one as the hardcore initial value for
Simplicity again we are not taking the
input from the user or from the browser
to do so we have to first go through the
Dom manipulations and we'll go through
it in later videos so let's start with
the switch case now
the Syntax for switch case is quite
simple just write down
switch and
pass the variable month
so we have to check in this round
bracket for the variable month because
you know any value you are providing to
month the switch will check the program
accordingly so for now we have taken the
value as one for month we can take any
value like we can take 3 we can take 11
12 or any value other than 1 to 12 as
well so whatever value you are providing
to the variable you can provide the
variable to the switch statement right
so next up we have an open and curly
braces for the body of the switch case
we have to test for 12 different
conditions inside this
starting from 1 to 12 right so the
syntax goes like this you have to write
case
and then the value month variable might
hold like 1 2 3 and so on followed by a
colon right so we have to write the
value 1 and
a colon not a semicolon but a colon keep
this thing in mind guys and below that
we are going to write what we want when
the value is 1 like what the output we
want when the value is 1 so we have to
write document
dot right
and
whatever you want as the output like for
one the first month is January so we are
writing here
January and a semicolon
so if the value of the month is 1 you
will get the output as January save it
and here you can see the output is
January
let me increase the font size for this
as well
so here you can see the output is
January right next we'll use a break
statement
if you guys remember we discussed the
break statement in the control
statements video right the break
statement is not actually a type of
control statement but it assists other
control statements or we can say it
helps us manage the control statements
right what this statement does is once
we are done with the output we get our
output right once we are done with case
1 we get our output as January this
break statement helps us to come out of
the switch case so to understand this
much better let's write here one more
case so let's say we are writing here
one more cases
case 2
and the output will be document dot
right
the second month is February right
and February we can write so
we'll include one break here like we'll
come in the first case and include a
break statement so here's how you can
write a break statement how you can
include a break statement in your code
so let's check the output now so for now
it says January
so if we don't include this break
statement here when The Interpreter will
execute this code
and it will see that the case is 1 right
so it will print January
but it will print other statements as
well so for example if we remove this
break statement and save it now see you
can see here the output as January and
February January and February both are
getting printed on the output so we need
a break statement to break it here see
the value is 1 and if we include break
statement here the moment The
Interpreter finds the answer the correct
answer is January it will come out of
the switch keys
so I hope you guys are getting this
similarly we'll write all the cases for
all the months let me show you all the
cases
so here you can see on your screen that
we have 12 different cases from 1 to 12
one for each month depending on the
value the variable month is holding
right
the output will be June if the value is
6 and if we say 10 the output will be
October and so on and so forth
now the question here is what if we try
to write a random value for the variable
month
by random value we mean that if we try
to write any value other than these 12
values from 1 to 12 if if you leave
these values then if we try to write
another value like if we write here 13.
so what will be the output now let's
save it and see there is no output and
there might be no error for this as well
so if you try to check for an error go
to inspect and check out
see there is no error right so in that
case we have one more case like we have
default case
so let me show you how to include
default in your program what you have to
do is write here default
with a colon and write
document
dot right and let's suppose we are
writing here
wrong input
what is happening is let's try to run
this program first
press Ctrl s and now you can see it says
raw input for value 13.
so what is happening is the switch case
will first check these 12 cases and any
value other than 1 to 12 will get the
output as wrong input it works the same
as the else statement right analysis
statement we don't need to specify any
particular condition any condition other
than the if condition or else if
condition will fall inside the else
statement it's not necessary to add
default in your program it's just if you
want to give the user a prompt that he
has entered a wrong value
so you must include this default case in
your program every time while using
switch gears because it's quite useful
you know okay so this is the complete
program to find out the month by
accepting its number so if you try six
and save it now it will say June if we
try 10 save it it will say October if we
try 12 save it it will say December so I
hope this is clear to you guys
next up let's discuss about switch case
in detail because the switch case in
JavaScript Works differently from other
languages like switch cases also present
in C plus plus and Java but in
JavaScript it is a bit different so in
JavaScript
switch case can accept numbers it can
accept strings and Boolean values as
well now let's have a look at how the
switch case works with string values
so here is an example of string values
you can see the value variable month is
holding is June right and you can use
this string in case as well so here you
have to give the case as a string value
right because we are using switch case
statement with
strings so the first case here is when
the value will be June the output should
be sixth month and when the value is
July the output will be 7th month so
let's check it out if this is working or
not let's save this program and see for
June it says sixth month and similarly
we can check it for July as well let's
check for July
save it and see it says seventh month
you can include the default case as well
if you want to it will be similar like
there's no difference for default case
let me show you how
will write here wrong input
save it and now let's try to change the
value here let's say we are using May
save it and see it says wrong input what
if we use a numerical value here let's
try to use two save it now it says wrong
input for 2 as well it will give you the
output when the value is either June or
July
so any other value you try to use here
it will give the output as wrong input
in the same way it works for Boolean
values as well let me show you how it
works for Boolean values so what you
have to do instead of 2 you have to give
here a Boolean value let's suppose you
are writing here true
and for true you have to change the case
as well for true
you have to change the output as let's
say for true it the output will be 1.
okay and similarly for false
the output should be zero
and the output should be wrong input for
any other case right so save it now and
see here for true it says one the output
you can see here is one and if you try
to do the same for false like let's
write here false
and now try to check the output see here
it says 0.
you can see the output is correct right

developer then this course by Caltech
ctme is the right choice for you
programming construct that executes a
piece of code as long as a certain
condition is met
all right and there are two different
types of Loops we have entry control
loops and exit control groups now what
exactly are entry control loops now
these are the loops where the test
condition is checked before executing
the piece of code
for example you have the for Loop and
the while loop so in their case before
entering the loop the condition is
checked and only if the condition is met
it enters the loop and executes the code
all right when it comes to exit control
loops the test condition is checked
after the loop has been executed all
right so in this case the loop at least
gets executed I mean the code in the
loop gets executed at least once
so the example for this is a two while
loop all right with this basic knowledge
let's go ahead and learn about the
different loops
so the first Loop is the for Loop all
right so what exactly is a for load this
is the basic logic and the flowchart in
front of you so what exactly happens is
that say for example you want to print
the word looping say 10 times right so
what you can do is you can start and you
can have a for Loop which goes from 0 to
9.
and then you increase the number by one
every time you print the loop once it's
equal to 10 or even greater than 10 it
ends the load right so let me help you
understand this better with an example
so let's go to our editor that is vs
code
here I've created a folder called demo
underscore Loops within which I've
created a file called for Loops all
right so now let's just write down our
initial code for HTML that is
HTML
and then I have a head tag
[Music]
within which I save JavaScript
loops
all right
now I have a body tag
[Music]
within which I give a heading for
clearer understanding let me have a
heading say
JavaScript
[Music]
for loops
all right
let me just call it for Loop
now let's have the script tag
[Music]
within which
I'll have
a variable say X
and now we have the for Loop so we say
for
x equals
0
X less than
five
X plus plus
in which I save console DOT log of x
so basically
what happens is
now you have
first readable which is called the
counter variable now this keeps track of
how many times the code is being
executed
right and next I less than 5 is a
condition now the loop keeps executing
as long as the condition is met
and lastly the counter variable is
incremented and usually it's incremented
by one right so here we've done the same
thing
and inside the loop we print the value
of x
all right so let me save the file
and then execute it
all right it's printed JavaScript Loops
here let me just go back
okay my bad I missed out on the title
tag
so this has to be enclosed within the
title tag so let me just
change it here
now let's save this
let's go back and just refresh the page
and that is it so whatever is in the
title tag basically appears here all
right so now since we're printing the
value of x on our console we'll have to
inspect our element so let's go here
and here let's check on console
and here you can see all the values have
been printed from 0 to 4. all right now
this is a simple for Loop
so next up is a while loop
now the logic is similar to that of a
for Loop first the condition is checked
and if the condition holds true then the
code is executed and if it is false it
terminates
all right so moving on let's understand
the general syntax
so here first you have the variable
whose value keeps changing
and then you have the ending condition
which is basically the maximum value a
variable can reach all right so let's go
back to our vs code
and here for better understanding let me
just change this to JavaScript while
loop
all right let's just
delete this and here let's initialize
the value of x to 1.
and now I say while X
less than or equal to 5
. within braces I
say console.log
of x
and then I increment the value of x
all right so let me save this and let's
execute the file
all right so it says JavaScript while
loop and let's inspect
and here in our console it displays the
values of x
all right so according to the logic
X is initially initialized to 1.
and the value gets executed once it
enters the while loop all right it's
incremented and then checked every time
until the value reaches
6 right and then it breaks from the loop
since the value does not hold true and
then it terminates
so this is a logic behind the while loop
next up is the two while loop
now here
as you can see first the code is
executed and then the condition is
checked if the condition is true then
the code execution continues and if it
falls it's terminated all right so this
is an exit control Loop also in an exit
control Loop the code is executed at
least once so let's go back to our vs
code
and here
let me just delete this
now let's initialize X to say
15 all right and now I use the do
keyword within which I write the code so
first I'm going to print the value of x
console DOT log of x
and then I increase my value
and here I mentioned my test condition
which is while X less than say 10.
all right so according to the logic
initially the value is X and once it
enters the loop here
it should print the value of x which is
15. all right and then it increments the
value but once it comes out of the loop
it checks for the condition
here the condition says less than 10 but
since X is not less than 10 it prints
the value X that is 15 and then
terminates all right so let's save this
and execute it
so let me execute this
and here
let's check
the console
so there we go it prints 15. so what it
does is that it prints the value 15
first and then checks the condition
now
let's go ahead and change the value of x
to save
5.
all right
so now it enters the loop and then it
prints the value of x and then
increments it and when it comes out of
the loop and checks the condition
as long as the value of x remains less
than 10 it prints it okay
so let's save this
go back here
and let's refresh the page
and here you can see the values 5 to 9
are printed so this is how the do while
loop works
moving on to the next concept breaking
out of a loop now as the name suggests
break is the keyword that is used to
break out a pillow now here is a simple
code for you
so according to the logic it prints the
values between 1 to 10. and say at the
value 5 you want to break out of the
loop you can simply use the keyword
break so let's go back to our vs code
and here let me just
make it simple
and Save
for x equals 1
X less than or equal to 10
let's increment it
and within the loop let's
display the value X
on the console and then we're going to
check for the condition if x equals 5.
all right
so if x equals 5 we break out of the
loop
so let's save the file and execute it
and there you go it's displayed the
values from 1 to 5.
so basically the code inside the for
Loop is executed and once the value of x
reaches 5 it breaks from the loop
simple right
all right so let's move on
next up we have skipping a loop cycle
all right so here what exactly we do is
we make use of a keyword continue to
skip a particular Loop cycle
say in this case we have a for Loop
which displays the values of I ranging
from 1 to 10. however we want to skip
the cycle when it reaches the value 3 so
what we do is we make use of the keyword
continue here so basically it displays
one and two and skips the third cycle
and then directly displays four all
right so let me show you in our vs core
editor
here
let me just remove this and Save
if x equals
five
I'm going to continue
all right
after which
I'm going to say console
DOT log f of x
so let me save this and then execute it
so here let me refresh the page
and there we go
as you can see it displays one two three
and four and the fifth cycle
is kept
all right and the rest of the digits are
displayed so that is how you can skip a
load I highly suggest you also practice
all of this and then play around with
loops to get a better understanding if
you want to master the field of web
development then the postgraduate
program in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll

started on your career as a full stack
web developer so what else can you
expect from this course this program
includes caltex ctme postgraduate
certificate you'll attend master classes
from Caltech ctm instructors simply

you want to become a successful web
developer then this course by Caltech
ctme is the right choice for you
so what exactly is an array
now an array object lets you store
multiple values in a single variable
it stores a fixed size sequential
collection of elements of the same type
now when array is used to store a
collection of data and it uses only
integers as element indices however
associative arrays can also use string
indices
moving on let's understand what array
operations are
now we can perform various operations on
an array in JavaScript
but let's start by creating an array
so for that let's go ahead and create a
folder first which will consist of the
file that we're creating right so for
that
let me just go ahead and create a folder
and I'll call it demo underscore adding
so once you're done with that open your
Visual Studio code editor
and here say open folder
and click on demo array
okay it's creating the workbench all
right and now here you can see the new
file icon so go ahead and create
demo.html file
all right here you go now let's start
typing the code
the first thing we do is type in our
HTML tag
and here I have the head tag
and let me say JavaScript
tutorial
all right and now let's create the body
tag
now within the body tag I create a
paragraph tag and create an ID
and let me call it demo
and then close the tag now I'll explain
to you why we're doing this a little
later
so first let's go ahead and create the
script tag
so say script
and within the script let's create our
array so let me use the keyword let
and say we give the name of the array
cars
equals in square based braces we say BMW
and Volvo
[Music]
and then say Honda
all right so now we create an array now
one more thing is that we use the
keyword let so that which indicates that
the array can be changed throughout the
program
all right so now we go ahead and display
it so I say document
[Music]
dot get element by ID
and here I say now the ID created was
demo so I say demo here
and I use the dot in our HTML property
which is equal to cars
okay let me change this to BMW first
all right so what exactly in our HTML
does is that it is responsible for what
is being displayed on the web page okay
now since we've taken ID as demo any
changes made is reflected in this ID and
then displayed onto the web browser
all right so let's save this and now
execute the file
so here I go back to my folder and then
the file and go ahead and click on it
so there you go
The Heading is displayed and the entire
array is displayed here
all right so let's go back to our vs
code
okay so I hope this was easy to
understand
now let's go ahead
so the next operation is to access an
array element
so let's go back to our vs code and here
let's create another variable say let
BMW BMW is a variable don't get confused
with the array element
so BMW equals cars of the index 0. so
basically cars of 0 is nothing but BMW
all right so that is being saved in the
variable BMW
and now let's just go ahead and display
this
so we let's just copy this
and paste it here and instead of cars
you use the variable name BMW that is
this one
all right
so now let's save this
and when we
execute it
you see BMW here that's how we retrieve
an element from an array next up we have
the array length property which displays
the length of the array
so again let me show you how to do that
let's go back to our code
and here let's create a variable and
let's call it length variable so I say
let Len
now you can use the length property
which will retrieve the length of the
array plus is as simple as that
and now after this again let's just
copy the same code here and then
let's pass Len
okay
now let's save this
and when you execute it again
it says three
so we've successfully retrieved the
length of the array
all right so the next operation is to
access the last array element right so
let's go back to our vs code and now
let's create another variable and let's
call it last
and we'll just say last equals cars
and within Square braces cars.length
minus 1.
right
so basically
the length of the array is 3 and 3 minus
1 is 2 so it should retrieve
cars of 2 which is Honda right
so let's just
execute this let me pass last here
save it and see if it displays
hondapuras
there you go
it's as simple as that
all right so moving on
the next array operation is Loop over an
array item
so for that let's go to our
code
and here
let's use the for load so I say cars dot
for each
for each
and within this we'll save
item
comma index
comma array
and now we use the arrow function
and display the content on the console
so I say console.log
of item
along with its index
so let's see this
and now let's go ahead and execute it
all right now as you can see nothing is
printed on your web page right because
whatever is being printed has to be
printed in your console so now click on
F12 which opens the developer options
and here you can see console so click on
that and now you can see the name of the
item in the array along with its index
so you see BMW 0 Volvo 1 and Honda two
all right so moving on now that we've
learned about the array operations let's
go ahead and learn about the array
methods
so the first method is to string now as
the name suggests it is used to convert
an array into a string
all right so let's go back to our vs
code
and now let's copy the same
code here
and here instead of last I just say
to string
now you can use this method
to convert the array into a string so
let's save this
and let's execute it
all right now here are the same output
as shown which means that the type has
only been changed to string type
All Right Moving On
the next method is pop now pop basically
removes the last element from the array
so let me show you how that works
let's go back to our vs code and here
we have to save the pop element into a
variable right so let's create a
variable say last
okay and oh since last is already used
let me call it last one
last one of cars.pop we can use the pop
method to pop the element
and now you can just copy the same code
to display this onto our web page
and here I just see
last one
now since we've popped the last element
the array has only two elements right
that is BMW and Volvo so if you want to
display the last element it should
display Volvo right so what we can do is
we can just create another variable say
last two
and just
use the same logic here
okay and now let's just
displayed on your console and let's say
last two all right
so now let's save it
now the popped element has been saved in
last one which is displayed on the web
page and the last element of the array
after the pop function has to be
displayed on our console
so let's go ahead and execute the file
all right so Honda has been displayed
that is the element that has been
removed from the array and now once we
check our console
here you go here you can see Volvo which
means that is the last element in the
array
moving on
the next method is the push method now
as the name suggests it is used to add a
new element to the array and remember to
the end of the array so let's go back to
our vs code
and here let me say cars
dot push push is the method that we're
using inside of which we'll say Audi all
right
and now let's just display the same
thing so let me copy this
and here let me say cars
okay so let me save it
and once I execute it
it says BMW Volvo and Audi so we'll
successfully added another element to
the end of the array
so the next method is the shift method
now basically shift is used to remove
the first element from the array now
this method shifts all the elements
reducing the indices of every element by
one all right let me show you how this
works
so let's go back to RVS code
and here let me just say cars dot shift
it's as simple as that and let's just
display this
let me copy the same thing
let's save it and when we execute it
here you can see it just displays Volvo
and audio so now cars has array elements
Volvo and Audi with array indices 0 and
1.
all right so moving on the next method
is on shift
all right so to add an element into the
beginning of an array we use the unshift
method therefore this method increases
the array index by 1. right so let's go
back to our vs code
and use the same function on shift
let's say cars.un shift
here we go let's
save it and here we have to specify what
we're adding right let me say Hyundai
okay
let's save this
and when we execute it you can see
Hyundai Volvo and Ori
it's as simple as that
all right moving on the next method is
the concat method now this is basically
used to merge two different areas right
so let's go back to our vs code
and sure
let's create another array first
and let's just call the array bikes
okay
and let's create say Yamaha
and let's say Suzuki
and then we'll say Royal Enfield okay
and now
let's save this
and say let Vehicles this is another
array which is basically the after
concatenation
the entire array is saved into this
array all right so let's say cars Dot
concat
of bikes we just concat bikes and cars
together
okay and then let's just
display this over the web page so
let me change this to vehicles
all right let me save this
so let's go ahead and execute it
there you go now both the areas have
been merged together into a single array
so the next array method is the sort
method now basically sort is used to
sort the entire array into ascending
order all right so let's go back to our
editor
and here
let's just use the
sort method on the array Vehicles all
right
Vehicles dot sort
okay
and let's just
display this on our web page
so again
let's go back and
execute it and here you can see it has
been sorted
the next method
is the reverse method so the reverse
method is again used to reverse that
elements in an array so is logic right
so sort was used to sort it in ascending
order now when you reverse it it just
sorts it in the descending order so
let's go back here
you want to copy the same thing
all right and here instead of sort
let me just say divorce
so let's save this and execute it
there we go it has displayed the entire
array in the reverse order
all right
with that we finish the array methods
next up we have map reduce and filter
first up we have array.map now the map
method is used for creating a new array
from an existing one by applying a
function to each and every one of the
elements in the first array and it does
not change the original array all right
so to make you understand this better
let's go back to our Visual Studio code
and now here let's first create another
area
okay so let me call this num1
and let's have
integers let's say 2 3 4 5.
6 and 7. okay
and now let's have another array
num2
so let's go ahead and say num1
dot map
of let me Define a function say multiply
okay
so multiply is a function that is that
I'm going to Define here
so let's say function
multiply
of value
okay
and inside this let me say return
value
into 2.
okay
so what this basically does
is that it multiplies each and every
element of the array num1 by 2 and saves
the new elements into the array num2
okay now after this let's go ahead and
display the contents so let me copy this
and let's display the content
in the array nump2
right so let me save it
let's go back here
execute it so there we go every element
has been multiplied by 2 and then
displayed again
I hope this was clear for you
now the next method is the filter method
so the filter method takes each element
in an array and applies a conditional
statement against it
and if this condition returns true the
element gets pushed onto the output
array but if it returns false the
element does not get pushed all right so
let me show it to you
now
let's
go ahead and create another
variable say num3
and here I say num1
dot filter
of say com now comp is a function
let me Define the function here
let me say function
comp
of value
takes a value as a parameter
within which I'm going to check if the
value is greater than 4.
now with only appends the element into
the array num3 if the value is greater
than 4. all right so now let me just
go ahead and change this to num3 all
right let's save this
and when we go back and execute
here we go
now the values so let's go back here let
me check
now num1 had the values 2 3 4 5 6 and 7
right so according to this it has to
only display it's 5 6 and 7. do not get
confused with num2 here we'll pass num1
here so it checks put this array
right so according to the logic it
should display 5 6 and 7 and it has done
so here
okay
moving on
the next method is the reduce method
now the reduced method reduces an array
of values down to just one single value
now to get the output value it runs a
reducer function to each element of that
array
okay now this method does not reduce the
original array again
so let's go back to our vs code
now let me create another
variables in num4
and say num1 dot reduce
and let me call it sum so what we're
basically doing is that we're adding all
the digits two three four five six and
seven in num1 to a single value right
that is the sum and then we're going to
be displaying that
so what we're going to do is let's
define the function here
function sum
basically is total comma value
right and then here let's say return
total Plus
the value
okay
and after this
I'm going to
display the content so let's say num 4.
okay let's save it go back and execute
here we go it displaces some of the
entire values in the array
this is pretty simple right
if you want to master the field of web
development then the postgraduate

collaboration with Caltech ctme can help

certificate you'll attend master classes
from Caltech ctm instructors simply
learns job assist will help you get

you want to become a successful web
developer then this course by Caltech
ctme is the right choice for you
JavaScript is is an object-oriented
programming language so everything in
Java is an object
a JavaScript object is like a real world
entity having State and behavior for
example a car now we can take a car as
an object it will have its state like
color and model it will also have
behaviors like accelerate and break
JavaScript is template based and we can
create objects without having the need
to create a class
generally object is accompanied by a
class that defines an object's
blueprints but JavaScript doesn't
require any class to be defined for
objects
moving on to the next concept
to create a JavaScript object now
basically there are three different ways
of creating a JavaScript object all
right so we look at them one by one
the first one is to use a literal to
create and Define a JavaScript object
so let's go to our vs code editor
now if you have any doubts regarding the
initial setup then I suggest you go
through the previous video that is
Javascript arrays to get you started
with it so here I've created a folder
called demo objects and now I'm going to
create a file
called create
underscore objects
dot HTML
all right
so we'll Begin by writing the initial
code
that is the head and the body so I say
HTML
[Music]
within this is the head tag
[Music]
and then I create a title tag
and let's say
JavaScript
objects
then after the head tag I'm going to
create a body tag
and let's create a heading and say
creating JavaScript
objects
okay
and now we create
an ID
all of this is explained in the previous
video I really suggest you go through
the video before and that you get a
clear picture
and then I say ID equals
say demo
and then I'm gonna close it
now the first method that we're going to
use to create an object is by using
object literals right so what we can do
is say script
within which I declare a variable
say
where student
now within the object we're going to
create three different properties now
this is basically like a dictionary it
has a property a key and then a value
okay so I say name property and let's
say
crisp
and then another property say age and
say 21.
and another property say
studies
and say maybe computer designs
okay
so this is the syntax used to create an
object using an object literally
now after this what we're going to do is
we're going to display this right now we
want to display the message saying Chris
of age 21 studies computer science
so what we can do is say document dot
get element by ID
and the ID that we're going to pass is
demo
we say
inner HTML
equals
student dot name
which is Chris
after which we display the message
of the age
and then the age that is student dot h
studies
student Dot
studies
okay let's save this
and when we execute the file it says
Chris of the h21 studies computer
science
all right this is one of the ways in
which you can define an object
all right so moving on to the next way
of creating a JavaScript object it is to
use the new keyword now this is the most
traditional way of creating an object
right so let's go back to our vs code
let's create another script
within which we see
where student equals new
object
I'm sure everybody has learned the same
way the same syntax
so this is one of the ways after which
we can say student dot name equals Chris
again student dot age
equals 21
[Music]
and then student Dot
studies
equals computer science
[Music]
all right
now after this we again
display the message so let me just copy
this
all right
so let's save this
and run our code again
and there we go it displays the message
crest of the h21 studies computer
science
all right this was the second method
used to create an object
all right so then moving on to the third
method
it is to use an object Constructor to
create and Define a JavaScript object
so let's go back to our code editor
and here
we Define a function so we say function
says start
with three parameters that is name H
and Save
studies
okay and now within the function we use
the keyword this so we say this dot name
equals name
all right and we say this dot h
equals h
when I say this dot studies
equals studies
now what we do is that we can
create a variable and pass parameters to
the function so we say where
two didn't
equals stud and within braces we say
Chris
comma 21
comma computer science
[Music]
all right so we've done passing the
parameters
after this
we're gonna copy the same
print message
[Music]
all right so let's save this and execute
our file
so let's refresh the web page
and there we go it still displays the
message place of the h21 studies
computer science so this was the third
method that can be used to create
objects
moving on to the next topic
object properties
now a JavaScript object is basically a
collection of unordered properties right
values associated with the JavaScript
object are called its properties
and properties can usually be added
updated or deleted excluding read-only
properties so now let's have a look at
the demo to help you understand this
better
so let me go back to my
vs code so this was where we left off
and this was how we created objects
right so now let me create another file
and let me call it
objects underscore properties
[Music]
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy the first piece of code here
all right let me just copy this into my
new file
and here as you can see student is the
object that we've created and name agent
studies are the three properties now say
we want to update the age all right so
what we can do is here we can just say
student
dot h
equals
let me change it to 24 all right
and let me save this and when we execute
the file that is object underscore
properties
you can see Chris of the age 24 so 21 is
updated to 24. so this is one of the
ways you can do it
or there's another method
you can just assign the property to a
variable and then display the variable
instead so what we can do is you can
just assign student.h to a property say
X
and here instead of displaying
student.age we can just say
all right so let's save this
and when we run it
it says 21 because we haven't updated
21 to 24 anywhere all right
so 21 Remains the Same
so another method we can use is we can
just say
x equals h
so we're directly assigning the property
to the variable
and here when I am displaying it I say
student of x
all right
so let me save this
and when you look at the web page
it still displays the same thing these
are different ways of accessing the
properties you can update them delete
them unless they're read only
all right so let's move on to the next
concept object methods now basically a
JavaScript method is an action that can
be performed on the objects
so you'll understand better with the
help of the demo
so let's go back to our vs code and here
I've created another HTML file called
objects underscore methods all right so
let's let me just copy the initial code
paste it here and let's have the
enclosing tags as well
and HTML all right now here I declare
another tag that is the button tag so
we're going to be making a button here
so I save button
ID equals click me so that is the action
that I'm going to
be performing
and the message that is going to be
displayed on the button will be
okay
all right
so we're going to see the usage of it a
little later
now let's go ahead and create an object
so I say script
[Music]
within which I create
[Music]
the user object
[Music]
so we're created using a object little
here and I declare the property name
as Chris again
and age
[Music]
24. okay
so let's close this
all right so the next thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a new function
that we will use as an object method
all right so I say function
and let's give the name say hi
okay
within the function we declare
we basically display a message so we're
going to say alert and hello
all right so this is going to be
displayed in a separate dialog box
so now once the Declaration is done
what we're going to do
is we're going to use
create another property basically say
user Dot
let's say message
and assign say hi to it
so basically what we're doing
is we're adding the previously created
method to a new property that is user
Dot message the message property all
right
so now I say
document dot get element by ID
is a demo
[Music]
and the message that I want is just
hi
plus the username all right
[Music]
so what we're going to do is we're going
to display the message hello
all right when the user clicks on the
button
so for that let's say
let's just copy this
[Music]
and here
instead of demo
right we're going to be passing the IDE
click me
as per this and the event is going to be
on click event
so here I say on click
after which I'm going to Simply pass
user Dot message
let me just delete this
all right so here I notice that I've
given an equal to sign I'm sorry it's a
colon
all right so let's save the file
and let's go ahead and execute it
all right so here you can see high crisp
being displayed and once we click on the
button
you can see an alert which says hello
all right
so now let's move on to the next concept
that is Java object accessors
now Getters and Setters allow defining
an object accessor all right to get the
value of a property in a JavaScript
object we use a getter and to set the
value of a property of a JavaScript
object we use a setup so let's go back
to our demo
and now let me create another file
and let's call it
object
accessors
and now again let me just
copy the first initial part
[Music]
all right so now let's go ahead and
create a new
object so let me say script
but then which I say where
and let's call it car all right
so let me define the properties say
model
and
the model is say BMW
320d
and
another property say color and let's say
it's navy blue
and the last property say fuel type
and let's see it's diesel
[Music]
now what we can do is we can you make
use of the keyword get
to access the properties so I say get
within which I return
this dot fuel type
all right it's as simple as that
so now let's display it document Dot
get element by ID
demo
dot inner HTML equals we say car
dot fuel
all right so now let's save it
and execute our file
here you go it retrieves diesel for us
now this is one of the ways of accessing
the properties
now to help you understand Setter let's
go ahead and create another
object
let's say where car again
now let's say the model
is
Audi A4
color be bright
red
[Music]
and fuel type let's keep it blank
all right
now to set the value we use the set
keyword we say set fuel
the parameter is fuel
within which we say this dot you will
type
[Music]
equals fuel right
now let's set the value for the fuel
say car dot fuel
equals petrol
all right
now let's display the same
let me copy this
and what we want to display is the fuel
type right so here we say fuel type
so let's save this
and let's go ahead and execute the file
and there we go it retrieves petrol so
what it does is basically it assigns the
value petrol to the property fuel type
and then we display the same on our web
page
so this is how you make use of Getters
and setters
if you want to master the field of web
development then the postgraduate
program in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with boot
camp level intensity and gain all you
need to be a full stack technologist
this program will give you the
foundation for building full stack web
apps using Java you will begin with the
basics of JavaScript and then Venture
into some of the more advanced concepts
like angular spring boot hibernate jsps
and MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer so what else can you
expect from this course this program
includes caltex ctme postgraduate
certificate your attend master classes
from caltex etma instructors simply
learns job assist will help you get
noticed by top hiring companies so if
you want to become a successful web
developer then this course by Caltech
ctme is the right choice for you
so basically a function is a group of
reusable code which can be called from
anywhere in your program right
when you have a piece of code that you
want to execute repeatedly in your
entire program it makes more sense to
Define it once and call it over and over
right it makes the code more efficient
and readable this also helps programmers
write modular goals
so this is the syntax you make use of
the function keyword followed by which
you mention the name of the function
the name of the function is completely
your choice next you mentioned the
parameter list and within curly braces
you can Define the function now the
function body is basically the code that
is executed every time the function is
called
so let's go to our vs code editor
and here I've created a folder called
demo functions within which I've created
an HTML file called functions.html
all right and now I've just typed in the
initial code
now let's create a function
so let me say script
within which I use the keyword that is
function keyword
and now I give
the name for my function I say my
underscore function
and the function takes a parameter say
value now this function basically
Returns the square of the digit all
right so within which
I say
document dot get element by ID
the ID is demo
and now it just displays value into
value
all right so the function basically
displays the square of the number
now outside the function let me call the
function
does my function let me pass the value
5.
all right now let's save this and
execute it
so let me go back to my file
and here we go it displays the value 25
so this was a simple function which took
a value
a digit as a parameter and then returned
the square
moving on to the next concept function
expression now what we learned
previously was function declaration but
a function can also be defined as an
expression now this is what the syntax
looks like now here the function is
created and assigned to the variable
explicitly like any other value
the meaning Remains the Same that is you
create the function and store the value
that it returns into a variable and in
our case it's X right so let's go to our
vs core and let me help you understand
this better
so now
I create another function
and here I say let
x equals let's use a simpler function so
I just mentioned function
and within curly braces I display an
alert message and I display a message
saying hello
all right
now
after that to display the message what
we can do is let me just copy this
output
code
if you paste it here
and here what we're going to be
displaying is the value X right now
since it consists of a function you'll
have to type the curly braces now this
is crucial for its execution all right
so let me save this and then execute
let me execute this
and here you go it says the site says
hello so we've successfully executed the
piece of code
we can also assign this variable X to
another variable and then call that
variable instead
right we can say let
Y equals X
and instead of calling X here
we can simply call Y
let me save it and then let me refresh
the page
and there we go it's still displays a
message hello
all right so this is one of the ways of
defining a function that is as an
expression
moving on to our next concept function
Constructor
now JavaScript functions are defined
using the keyword function right now
functions can also be defined using a
JavaScript built-in function
now this is the basic syntax so here
we've created a function called my
function and we've used the keyword new
after which we have used the Constructor
function
and inside we provide the parameter list
after that the return value
next you can call the function here
right so let me just go back to my vs
code
and now let me just make changes to the
same piece of code here
I create a function say my underscore
function
okay all right let me just change the
name
to my function all right
and then here I use the keyword new
and the function Constructor that is
function
[Music]
within which I'm passing all the
parameters so I have
a b
now I'm going to return the sum of the
digits
all right
and now while calling the function
let me just store the value in a
variable say X
and let's call the function that is my
function
with the parameters 2 and 3.
all right
and now let me just play it so I'm just
gonna copy this
and I want to display the value of x
right
all right so let me save this and
execute it
if you refresh the page it displays the
sum that is 5.
to make it more readable let me just
display another message here
let me just save
the sum is
all right
let me save it and then refresh the page
it says the sum is 5.
all right now this is how you make use
of the function Constructor
next up we learn about self invoking
functions
now as the name suggests these functions
are invoked automatically without being
called now previously when we learned
about function Expressions we saw that
parentheses were crucial
so you have to add parentheses around
the function to indicate that it is a
function expression so here is a Syntax
for you so what we've done is we've made
sure we've enclosed the entire function
within parentheses
so let me help you with that let's go
back to our vs code
and let me create another script
and here let me create the function
within the parentheses and say function
it's not taking any parameters
instead it is going to
alert for message so let me say
hello welcome
right
after which
we're going to call the function so
again we have to mention the parentheses
let's save this
and execute
so when we refresh the page it says
hello welcome
so whenever call the function rather it
got invoked by itself so these are
self-invoking functions
now let's go ahead and look at functions
as values
now in JavaScript a function is
basically a value so we can deal with it
as a value now here is a simple syntax
now if you closely look at the syntax
you might think that this is same as
function Expressions well no in this
case what we do is we first Define the
function and then we assign it to a
particular variable but in the case of
Expressions the function definition was
defined during the initialization of the
variable right and also we have to
specify the parenthesis in order to call
the function so to help you understand
this better let me go back to our vs
code and here
let me just erase this
and let's define a function that Returns
the product of two digits so let me just
call it product
which takes two parameters let me say A
and B
within which we return the value
a into B
all right now after this let's create
another variable say y
equals function oh I'm sorry the name of
the function is product so product of 2
and 5.
right so this basically returns us 10
right so let me just copy this to
display this on our web page
and here I change the message to the
product
and here let me change it to y
so let's save this and execute it
so let me refresh the page and here you
go you can see the message the product
is done
now what we can do is we can make
alterations to this now say I want to
multiply the value
with 5 again
right so basically this returns 10 and
that value is multiplied by 5. so let me
save this
and refresh our page and there we go it
returns
and there we go it displays 50. so this
is how you can make use of functions as
values
moving on to the next topic functions as
objects
now JavaScript functions are a special
type of objects called function objects
now a function includes a string which
holds the actual code that is the
function body of the function the code
is literally just a string although not
recommended you can also create a
function with the help of the function
Constructor I will show that to you a
little later on but for now let's look
at the syntax
now here we have a variable called body
which basically consists of the function
body its enclosed in double quotes and
that's a mistake please ignore it all
right so next we have variable function
name so here we create a function using
the keyword new and then we pass a
parameter list and the body basically
tells us what the function returns right
next we have an alert message to call
the function so let me just show how
this is executed
let me create another
function
and let's say the function Returns the
area of a circle right so let me just
create
a body variable
which returns
so the area of circle is pi R square so
we make use of math dot pi
into radius
into radius right
so it's basically Pi R square
after which
let's see where Circle
[Music]
and here let's create a function using
the new keyword
function
and then here we pass
the value that is the radius
and then the body
right so basically this is the
definition of our function
so let's use alert
to display the area so we say alert of
circle
or five
all right so let me save this and
execute it
so when you refresh the page
it displays the area of the circle
so this is how you can use functions as
objects
moving on to our next concept Arrow
functions
now functions can be written more
compactly and more precisely with the
help of Arrow functions all right now
Arrow function expressions are
Illustrated as methods and they cannot
be used as Constructors
now also while using Arrow functions
using const is a safer option because a
function expression is always a constant
value
so this is the syntax now you can only
omit the return keyword within the curly
braces if the function is a single
statement
so this is the syntax first you provide
the name of the function
with an equal to sign followed by the
argument list and later you make use of
this Arrow icon and Define the
expression so this is basically nothing
but this
so let's go back to our vs code and
check for ourselves
so let's create another function
and here let me say
const
my funk
equals now say we want to display the
product of three digits so let me just
pass ABC on my parameters
and you make use of this icon which
indicates that this is an arrow function
within which I say return a into B into
C
all right
now let me just assign this to a
variable
okay let me say
product because we've used X here
and then let me call my function that is
my func and pass the value 2 3 and say
4.
all right so let's display the product
so let me just copy this
code
and here let me say the product
of the three
digits is
and let me say product here
because that is what is being used here
right all right so let me save this and
execute it
all right first it displays the area of
the circle all right and let me say okay
and there we go it displays the message
the product of the three digits is 24.
so let me do one thing let me just
comment this out
okay
let me save it and then execute it again
it just displace this
all right so this is how we can make use
of Arrow functions
moving on let's look at the generator
function
now regular functions typically return
only one value right or a single value
or sometimes even nothing but a
generator function can return multiple
values and the specialty is that it can
do it so on demand all right now to
create a generator function we make use
of an asterisk
so an asterisk indicates that the
function is a generator function
so here you can see that we have a
function followed by asterisk and we've
created a function called generator
sequence
so here you can see we have the
asterisks after the keyword function
followed by the name of the function
right
but the main method of a generator
function is the next method when this
method is called it basically runs the
execution until the nearest yield value
all right all the nearest yield
statement then the function execution
pauses and the yielded value is returned
to the outer code
all right so the result of the next
method is always an object with two
properties it has a value property which
is basically the yielded value
and then it has a done property which
displays true if the function code is
finished or false if it's otherwise
so let me show its execution for a
clearer understanding so let's go back
to our vs code
and here let's create the generator
function
let's say function asterisk
generate
function all right
now within which
I make use of the keyword yield
and I say yield one first
followed by yield
2
and finally I make use of return which
indicates the termination so I say
return 3.
all right
now we make use of
a variable say generator
[Music]
and assign it to the generator function
that is generate
funk
and now I create another variable say 1.
which will basically return the value
when I call the next function so here I
say generator
dot next
okay so whatever generator dot next
returns it's stored in one
so to display the message I say alert
and now I'm going to make use of a
method called Json Dot stringify
[Music]
all right so basically this method
converts a JavaScript object or a value
to a Json string
alright so within which I'm going to say
1.
that is this
all right
so now let me save this
and execute it
Let me refresh the page and there you go
here it returns
two properties that is value and done it
says value is 1 and done is false right
it is false because we haven't reached
the return statement yet
foreign
so what we can do is to display the rest
let me just copy these
and display it one by one
see there let's see this
and here let me say two
and this is three
let me copy this
okay here I say
two
and then I say three
all right so let me save this and then
execute it
so when I refresh the page it says one
and false
after which again it says 2 and false
and finally when it displays three it
returns true for the done property that
means we've reached the end of the
function definition
so this is how you make use of a
generator function
now let's move on to our last topic that
is predefined functions
now JavaScript has many built-in
functions all right now here are a few
of them we have eval parseint pass float
escape and unescape now let's go through
one by one
all right first up is eval now this
basically evaluates a string and returns
a value all right so to help you
understand this better let me go back to
our vs code
and now let me just create another file
and let me call it
redefined
functions.htn all right
and I've just copied the initial code
all right so for eval the syntax is eval
within which
I see
expression
all right now this is the general syntax
so what this eval does is that it
evaluates the expression
and if the result is not a string the
result is just returned and if the
result is a string it is taken to be a
JavaScript program and evaluated
so let me show you how it's done
so first let's create three variables
all right let's call them X
and initialize it to 5.
then y
with six
and then let Z be 7 all right
now let's just displace the result on
the console so say console.log
eval
or let me say X Plus y
all right
after which I again say console.log
of event of set
here since the expression is a string
this gets evaluated
and here since it's not a string it just
Returns the value Z
and here since it is not a string it
just Returns the value of Z so let me
save this and then execute it
all right so let me just
check our console
there you go it evaluated the expression
and added the two values that is X and Y
and returned 11. while Z is returned as
it is
all right this is what eval does
next up is parseint now as the name
suggests it passes a string argument and
returns an integer of the specified
Radix or base
and the syntax basically includes the
keyword parse and the string within
parenthesis
Parts float on the other hand passes a
string argument and returns a floating
Point number again the syntax has the
keyword pass float along with the string
within parenthesis
next up is escape now this Returns the
hexadecimal encoding of an argument
and on the other hand an escape Returns
the ASCII string for the specified value
if you want to master the field of web
development then the postgraduate
program in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help

you want to become a successful web
developer then this course by Caltech
ctme is the right choice for you so
let's move ahead and today we will
discuss a completely new topic which is
prototypes in JavaScript so for this
video we are going to use console for
printing that's because it will be easy
for you guys to understand the concept
of prototypes if we use the console
instead of using a normal document.write
method
so let me do one thing guys we'll print
a statement on the console
so
we'll write here
console.log and will print
let's say
welcome to Simply code
so let's save this and if we open
console here in our browser
we have to go to inspect and then we
have to go to console and here you can
see we have welcome to Simply code
written over here
so in the last video we talked about
creating an object with the help of
object literal method right so let's
suppose we are creating an object here
with the help of same object literal
method so what we have to do we have to
create an empty object first so let's
say our object name is ABC
and we'll use the curly braces here so
what we have to do is we have to pass
the properties here so let's suppose our
properties are name and the value of
name let's say
followed by a comma and then we have
let's say subject value of subject will
be
let's say JavaScript
and then finally we have the
address so let's say the value of
addresses Bangalore right
this is a basic object we made right if
we write here console.log ABC so if you
want to print this object on the console
so what we'll do here we'll write
console.log and then we'll use ABC so
let's save this now and here you can see
on the console that we have our
objective so we have our object with all
the three properties we have address as
Bangalore we have name as kaushal and
subject as JavaScript
so if you guys look here carefully
you'll notice that we have one more
entity here that is we have underscore
underscore Pro 2.
so what is this underscore underscore
Proto so all right we mentioned all the
other three properties in our object but
we didn't do anything for this
underscore underscore Proto so let's
discuss this now let's take a scenario
wherein someone told us to create a
website like let's suppose we have to
make a travel website through which
people can book their travel
destinations now do we have to start
creating the website from scratch no
that's because we have some of the
necessary conditions already fulfilled
like we have Chrome we already have
bootstrap for styling and all and we can
use bootstrap to design a website right
so we have certain things already
present and we have to work over them to
create our website similarly prototype
refers to the destination from where we
started to create an object like we have
methods for arrays we have objects and
strings as well so all these methods are
being inherited from somewhere so
whenever we create an object using the
object literal method then it will start
creating the the object from the object
dot prototype so if we click here on the
underscore underscore Proto
we have access to a list of methods
already present within the object dot
prototype so and all of them are
predefined we can use any of them we
didn't Define them they are already
present we Define only these three
properties like we defined address name
and subject only
in simple words all JavaScript objects
inherits properties and methods from a
prototype date objects inherit from date
dot prototype and similarly when we use
array objects they inherit from
array.prototype so the object dot
prototype is on the top of the Prototype
inheritance chain so date objects array
objects and person objects all these
objects inherit their properties from
object dot prototype so moving on now
let's create another object so we talked
about the object literal method so here
we don't have too much to do so let's
move ahead and we'll create another
object this time we'll create it with
the help of a Constructor function so
let's create a function here first let's
say we have a function named as function
XYZ
so then we have the parameters as name
and then we have we'll take all these
three properties we will take name
subject and let's say
address
so then we have the body of the function
inside which will use the this keyword
we'll write here this dot name equals to
name
similarly this Dot address equals to
address
and finally we have this Dot
subject equals to subject
so we'll create an instance now let's
say we are creating an object let's say
our object name is where
X1 and we'll write here new
and then we'll write XYZ and we'll pass
the values so let's say the name is
kaushal and we have
subject as let's change the subject
we'll write here Java and we have
finally have the address let's say the
address is Earth
okay so the values are different from
the previous example we took what we'll
do now we'll write here
console.log and will print
X1 now so we are done creating an object
and here we have a Constructor function
named XYZ and then we have few
properties which are the same as we used
in the previous example so then we have
an object named X1 which holds the
values for all three properties and
lastly we printed the object on the
console so let's save it now and we can
see here in console we have the object
with all the properties this almost no
difference here from the object literal
method right but when we click here on
the Pro 2 here we can encounter the
difference now you can see here we have
one more entity here named as the
Constructor so this Constructor here has
its own prototype
so this Constructor here has its own
prototype if we use a Constructor in a
program it always has its own prototype
this might seem a bit difficult to you
guys but don't worry it will be apparent
to you guys once we move on to the usage
and modifications of prototype so here
we are with the two examples in the
first one we created an object with the
help of object literal method there we
saw that it has only a single prototype
that is the object prototype later when
we moved on to the Constructor function
method we realized that there are two
different prototypes present one is the
Prototype which is available every time
that is the object dot prototype and the
other one is the constructor's OWN
prototype it might sound a little hard
to you guys but prototype is nothing but
it refers to the point from where it all
started from where we have inherited all
the properties
so we can make changes to the Prototype
of our own object like if we want to add
something to our prototype we can do it
we have a method for that in JavaScript
we'll do it later in this video we can't
make changes to the object prototype
remember this thing guys I'll suggest
you not to edit the object dot prototype
because it's not a good practice to make
changes in that if you want to edit any
prototype then we have to make sure that
we are making changes in our own
prototype that we made with the help of
Constructors the Prototype made by us is
also inherited from the object dot
prototype if we want to make another
prototype here we can do it like if we
are going to add utility functions to
our program but at the same time we
don't want to do anything with the
properties of a Constructor function we
can make another prototype for that we
can create a prototype for separate
method so if we want to add a method in
this Constructor function we can do it
we can add it separately with the help
of prototypes so for that we have to
follow a syntax a particular syntax we
can do it this way like we have to write
here x y z dot prototype and then we
have to write the method name let's say
we are writing here
get name
fine we'll write a function
and then we have the body of the
function so let's suppose this method
Returns the name
so we'll write here
return
this
dot name so if we try to run this
program now we can see there is no
difference from the previous one but if
we check the prototypes now so here you
can see we have another prototype named
as get name
so this is how we can edit the Prototype
of our object now if we try to access
this get name method with the help of X1
object so we can do it so let's try to
do it on Console we'll write here
X1 dot get name
and
see here we have the output as caution
similarly let's create one more
prototype here to remove any sort of
confusion so what we'll do we'll create
another
prototype so let's say we are creating a
prototype for
address now so what we'll do we'll write
here x y z Dot
prototype
Dot
get
address
so it will be a method so we'll write
here function
we don't have to pass any parameters
here
so let's suppose it return
the value of address
so we'll write here this dot address and
we are good to go so let's save it now
and if we go to Pro underscore
underscore Pro 2 we can see we have one
more prototype here named as get address
so what we have to do now is we'll make
another object let's say we are copying
this from here
we'll paste it here
so let's change the values let's say we
write here Mars and then we have let's
change the subject basically because we
are
looking for the subject so let's change
this value as well
let's say we have here
simply code
and we'll change the name of the object
let's say we have X2 now save it and if
we write here
X2 Dot
let's say get name
so here you can see the output as simply
code similarly if we write here instead
of get name we write here get address
so here you can see the output as Mars
because the value we passed while
creating the object is Mars here so we
can access this value directly using the
Prototype method so if we use the object
Constructor function if you guys
remember we cannot add a new property to
an existing object for example if we try
to add a property here let's say if we
try to add a property to this existing
function what we can write here is
x y z Dot
grades
let's say the grid is
e
so if we save this now
here you can see there's nothing changed
here so we don't have any change in the
prototypes or we don't have any changes
in the properties as well so we simply
can't add a property to an existing
function like this but we have a method
for this also so to add a new property
to a Constructor we must add it to the
Constructor function or we can use the
Prototype property here as well so the
JavaScript prototype property allows us
to add new properties to a object
Constructor just like we added the
methods to a Constructor function
previously similarly we can add
properties as well so we have to write
here so we'll remove this line
we have to write here x y z Dot
prototype
and then we have to write the property
name here let's say we are writing here
grids and then we'll pass the value
let's say the grade is a
so if we save this now and if we go back
here and if we check the underscore
underscore Pro 2. so here you can see we
have a property here named as grades and
the value is a so if we try to print X1
dot grade in our console so the output
will be a so let's try to do it here
we'll write here
x 2 Dot
grids
and here you can see the value is a here
so we can add a property to an existing
Constructor function with the help of
prototype methods so this is the basic
usage of prototypes in JavaScript we can
use prototypes to add a property or a
method to an already existing
Constructor function if you want to

become a successful web developer then
this course by Caltech ctme is the right
choice for you the first one will be the
one wherein will recreate Flappy Birds
using JavaScript
now many of you guys must have heard
about this game already if not we have
to take a bird through a space between
two walls in this particular game so let
me just take you through the game once
and here we are so this is our game you
can see we have a bird over here and we
have to take this bird through this
yellow hole present in between the blue
color right the yellow holes are random
and if the bird strikes the blue wall or
maybe at the bottom of the screen then
the game will over fine so I hope you
guys understood what we have to do in
this particular game now we have to
press a key from the keyboard to make
the bird jump repeatedly and we have to
make the bird jump so that the bird will
go through the hole between the walls
without touching the boundaries of the
hole so I hope you guys must have
understood the task here
now let's try to recreate this game
again from scratch and will do
everything by ourselves we'll go through
the HTML part will go through the
JavaScript and we'll go through the CSS
as well both HTML and CSS will play a
vital role in making this game along
with the JavaScript part obviously so
let's start with the code we'll go back
to vs code and here you can see we have
a HTML file named Flappy bird.html so
we'll change the title of this as well
we'll write here
instead of document we'll write here
Flappy Bird fine save it
now first of all we'll take a container
for the game to run so as you can see
here we have a container over here fine
so this is a container now we have to
create this whole container now what
we'll do for that is we'll go to the
body tag and we'll write here
div
ID is let's say game
and we'll close this step now inside
this particular div we'll create three
more div tags so we'll write here div
ID is equals to block or we can write a
pipe as well for the wall or for the
pipe we can say
the next we'll write here div
ID is equals to whole that is for the
whole
and the last one is for the
bird fine so we'll write a div ID is
equals to bird
we'll close this diff and a fundamental
task is done here now we have a
container for the game we'll put the
game inside one single container the
next thing we need in a game is a block
which we'll use to create the walls in
the game followed by the hole in the
block for the bird to go through it
right and the last thing is the bird
itself so we'll add an image here for
the bird so let's do some styling for
all this that we have written over here
so what we'll do is we'll move to a CSS
file so this is a CSS file
and we'll write here
for the whole document the margin will
be
0 by default
okay so we'll write here 0 and
the padding will be
zero as well fine
we are good to go that's a common thing
the margin and the padding will remain
zero for the whole HTML document the
next thing is to create the background
of whole document
so we'll do something creative here
something different from what we did
till now so what we'll do is we'll
create the background with two different
colors
now you might be thinking of what these
two different colors are so what we'll
do is we'll write here body
and then we'll write here
background color will take any
background color
let's say we are taking credit blue fine
now save it save this part as well and
open this on live server
so here you can see we have a background
we have the background of HTML document
as cadded blue color now the next thing
we'll do is we'll use two different
colors over this background right so
we'll write here
background image and we'll write here
webkit linear gradient and we'll write
here RGB
175 comma 75 comma 75
then we'll write here
RGB so these are three particular colors
will write here
31 comma 31 comma 31
and the last one will be
RGB
59 comma 153 comma
1 4 8.
fine
so here we are and the next thing we'll
do is we'll write here
Min height will be 800 pixels
now save it
and you can see here we have three
different colors over here we'll go to
our CSS file and you can see this webkit
linear gradient over here is unknown to
us right so CSS gradients let us display
smooth transitions between two or more
specified colors so we can do it
radially or linearly
now let's see the difference
and you can Spot the Difference here in
the output we have three different
colors over here we have red black and a
little bit of gray in between right so
let's move on to the first container and
we'll create the game area now
now what we have to do is we have to
create the game area
so what we'll do is we'll access the div
tag with IDs game
and let's start working on this div tag
and we'll understand it much better
so we will write here
game
and we'll write here next up
height of this container will be let's
say 500 pixels
width
is let's say 400 pixels so guys remember
this height and width we'll need them
later
now the next thing we'll do is we'll
write here
border
and the Border will be one pixel solid
black in color fine
and we'll add a background image as well
we'll write a background image
or we'll write a background only
we'll write a URL and inside this we'll
write
fine
save it now and you can see here we have
a container over here
now it's not working it says there's no
such image present in a folder so what
we'll do is we'll check it from here
here we are
we have bg2 over here not bg1 so we'll
write here bg2.jpg save it now
and move back to the browser and here
you can see we have an image over here
so it's not quite visible till now so
what we'll do is we'll write here
background size is
fine save it now
and here you can see we have an image
over here now the image looks fine
the next thing we'll do is we'll write
margin
and we'll write here
margin and the margin will be one ram
and
Auto fine save it now
you can see we have the Block in between
now the next thing we'll do is we'll use
the Overflow property here and it will
not show the bird going out of the box
so we'll see it in a moment but this
overflow property will do so what we'll
do is we'll write here overflow
is equals to Hidden save it now
you can see it's not making any
difference as of now but we'll
understand it later
now we have a box over here on the
browser and the game will be played
inside this particular box now we have
to work on the div for the block
so we have to create a block and that
block will move again and again through
the screen with holes present at a
random place every time fine I hope you
guys got it so let's tile the block now
what we'll do is we'll go to a CSS file
and we'll write here
hash
block fine so this is the ID for the
block
now inside this will use
width as 50 pixels
then we have
height
so the height will be 500 pixels equal
to the height of the whole container the
next thing we'll write here is
background
color and the background color will be
let's say
blue fine
we'll write here
position as relative
and then we'll write here
left
400 pixels fine now we know that after
saving this piece of code the block will
not be visible anymore so why is it not
visible it's a question right it arises
in every person's mind save it and here
you can see the block is yet not visible
now what we have to do is we have to set
the left property as 200 let's try to do
it 200 ones so what we'll do is we'll
write here
200 pixels save it now
and here you can see we have a block
over a screen now the value of left
property is 200 means the block is
present
200 pixels from the right most corner of
the container
if we write here 400
and save it
you can see we don't have any block here
it means that the block is present right
after this entire container the block
starts here and goes till here it's a 50
pixels wide block and it's not visible
because we have set the left property as
400.
so now the next thing we have to do is
we need some animation over this box
right or we can say we need some
animation over this block right so what
we'll do is
we'll write here animation and we'll
write here block we have
to perform it on a block and the
animation time will be two seconds we'll
write here linear and
it will go to infinite fine
now this animation property will help us
in moving the Box again and again after
every two seconds
and the moving points we have to Define
here so for that what we have to do is
we have to write here
at the rate
keyframes
after this will write here block
and inside this will write zero percent
left will be
400
pixels
and at 100 animation
what we'll do is we'll set the left
property yes
minus 50 pixels fine
now you guys might be wondering what we
are doing here but this keyframe here is
a rule that specifies the animation code
and it will help the block move again
and again from 400 pixel in the right to
minus 50 pixels in the left
fine save it
and we'll go to the browser you can see
the box is moving again and again after
every two seconds or two milliseconds
now the next thing we have to do is with
the hole in the block so we have to put
a hole here in the block and for that we
have to access another div with IDs
whole
fine so we will move to a CSS file and
we'll access that particular
element with IDs whole so we'll write
here hash whole and inside this we'll
write
height of the hole will be
150 pixels less than that of the block
width will be
50 pixels same as the block
and then we'll write here
background
color
fine so let's say the background color
is
yellow
this is for
practical purpose you can change it by
yourself the next thing we'll write here
is position Position will be
relative
left will be
400 pixels
and
top will be
minus 5 double zero pixels fine
then we'll write a animation again we'll
write a block we'll write here two
seconds we'll write a linear
and we'll write here
infinite fine
now this hole will also go with the same
animations as the block
save it
and open the browser and here you can
see the hole is not properly over the
block they are both at different
locations so we can try to refresh this
code and here you can see
the hole is now present at the top of
the block so here is the whole this
yellow part represents the hole for this
particular game
now it is working totally fine
and this is an empty space to make this
hole randomly come anywhere in the block
we have to do some magic with JavaScript
for that so we'll do it later in this
video
now if the hole is not placed over the
Block in your code don't worry just
refresh the code or we can say just
refresh the home page it will be fine or
if not it will get fine once we go
through the JavaScript part that's not a
major deal
so let's move on to the bird now what
we'll do is we'll add an image to our
HTML file for the board
so we'll write here
inside the HTML file will write here
where the ID is put will write here
IMG
okay we have
we will write here SRC is equals to
bird
one dot PNG
so let me check if this file exists in a
system or not
so here we are we have bird dot PNG not
bird1 DOT PNG
save it and what we'll do is we'll write
here
alt is
but we'll close this IMG tag save it
open the browser and you can see the
bird is not visible as of now to make
this image visible we have to work on
the styling so we will access this image
with the ID bird
what we'll do is we'll go to the CSS
file again and we'll write here
hash
bud
the next thing we'll write here is
position
so Position will be
fixed
and top of bird will be
100 pixels
then we have
height is
50 pixels and
width will also be
50 pixels fine we'll do the same for
image tag as well so we'll write here
bird
IMG
and inside this will write
height
as 50 pixels and we'll write a width
fine yes
50 pixels
I mean
now save it and if you open the browser
now
you can see we have a bird in our game
now we are halfway done in making a game
and we haven't used any JavaScript until
now right that's quite funny so we'll
use JavaScript now
let's move on to the JavaScript part
we'll go to the JavaScript file first
now first of all we'll access every
element of a Javascript file that we can
access
so we'll use the get element by ID
method to access every element of our
HTML file
what we'll do is we'll write here where
hole so
whole is the ID of whole present in the
block
so we can access that div tag here we'll
write here
document Dot
get element by ID and we'll write here
whole fine
the next thing is we'll write here where
game
is equal to document Dot
get element by ID and the ID will be
the ID will be game fine
so for now we need to access these two
elements only we'll add some more
elements later and then we'll access
them so for now let's focus on these two
only
next up we need the hole to be placed in
random places in the block every time
for that we need an event listener so
we'll create a function that will change
the location of this hole every time it
will change the location on every
iteration of the block fine
so we'll write here whole Dot
add event listener
and we'll write here
animation iteration so this is a event
listener and we'll write here a function
name so let's say we are writing here
fine so this is a function it's random
hole so we'll write here run hole now
we'll declare this function as well
we'll write you
function run hole and
inside of this function we'll take a
variable random let's say so this is a
variable we'll write here
minus
math Dot
random
so this is a function and will
multiplies this value by 350.
so this means that it will take any
random value between 0 and 350. fine and
then what we'll do is we'll add 150 to
that particular value and the whole
value will be changed to minus
we'll see it in a moment why we are
doing so so the next thing we'll write
here is
whole dot style Dot
left now hold dot style Dot top
is equals
to random
Plus
pixels fine I hope you guys got it till
now so this math dot random function
will pick any random value between 0 to
350 and 150 will be added to that
particular value because we don't want
the value to go down as low as 10 and
the whole will go out of the containers
borders so the initial value of the
whole was let's check it out
so here we are in a CSS file so you can
see the initial value of whole
was minus 500 pixels for top fine
so the new value will be random plus
pixels
the value was 500 because we wanted the
whole at the top of the block and now it
will take any random value and the whole
will be placed according to that
particular random value
so let's save it
open the browser and here you can see
the hole is moving randomly now you can
see it was initially present at the top
now it is at the bottom here so it will
change the location randomly according
to the random number picked up by the
math dot random function so let's get
back to the JavaScript part now before
we move on to the fall and game over
function let's discuss the game over
scenario first and we'll finish out all
the necessary HTML and CSS tasks for the
game over
so the game will be over when the bird
strikes the pool or either the bird
falls down to the ground
on game over the score will be shown on
the screen with a restart button right
so the score will be counted on the
basis of blocks passed by the boats now
the number of blocks passed will be the
final score
so we'll take a variable score and
increase the value of this score
variable with each random block coming
through
so we'll take a variable score and we'll
write here
where score
is equals to zero the initial value will
be zero so let's do the HTML part
wherein will use a div tag to print the
result on the screen
what we'll do is we'll go to the HTML
file and here what we'll do is we'll
write here after this particular div tag
will write
div ID is equals
to result
and here we have another div tag present
over here now inside this div tag
we'll use a H1 tag and we'll write here
game over
fine next thing we'll do here is we'll
use P tag with IDs
let's say text fine
we'll close the P tag here or the
paragraph tag we can say now we need a
button so we'll write a button
ID is equals to BTN
will write here on click
is equals to location
Dot reload
and we'll write here
restart fine
now the HTML part is done the paragraph
tag with IDs text will be used to print
the score on the scoreboard now this
location Dot reload method is used to
reload the whole web page on clicking
the start button the entire page will be
reloaded and the game will start again
fine we'll use CSS to style all of this
gamer part
so we'll go to the CSS file and here's
the CSS file now we'll write here
hash result we are accessing the div tag
with ID as a result
so the height will be
let's say 200 pixels for result
and the width is let's say
500 pixels fine so
if I show you once again so here is the
block for game over scenario so the
height is 200 pixels and the width is
500 pixels basically we need to create a
card right or we can say a rectangle
so we'll move back to the CSS file and
we'll write here
background color is let's say down
margin will be
5 Frame Auto
so margin top will be 5 rep and then it
will do it automatically then we'll
write here
border so border will be 2 pixels solid
and the color will be white fine
we'll write here
border radius
so the Border radius will be let's say
20 pixels we want rounded borders and
the display will be
none fine
the last thing we'll do is we'll write
here text align
as Center it will align the text in the
center
and the next thing we are left with is
the button fine so we'll write here hash
BTN
because the ID of button element is BTN
so we'll write here
padding
0.5 frame
and one ram fine
the Border
will be none because we don't need any
border for this button
we of course want the button to be round
from the corners so we'll write a border
radius as 11 pixels
background color is
green
color is
White
font size is
1.5 Ram
will write here text
transform
uppercase
will write here margin top
one ram
so guys you can see we are using this
Ram again and again so I might wonder
that if any one of you knows the exact
definition of this word Ram if yes then
do let us know in the comments below and
let's see how many of you guys know the
actual definition of this term
so the last thing we'll do is we'll
write here cursor is equals to pointer
and we are good to fine the next thing
is we'll write here hash text
margin
top will be
one ram
and
font size will be
2 RAM fine
we'll do one more thing we'll write here
color is
seashell so this will be the color of
our text so we are now totally done with
the HTML and CSS part the only thing
remaining now is the JavaScript part and
we have to work on that only
so just a few more refers statements and
all and we are done with the game
now moving back to the JavaScript part
but before we go there let me just show
you how this works save it and go to the
browser so this is a game and you can't
see any game over scenario here right so
for that what we have to do is we have
to go here in result and we have to
comment this
particular statement fine
display has done we have to comment out
this statement save it now
and it's not working
now vessel okay here's a mistake in this
div tag
what we did wrong here is
so this was a mistake save it now
and now here you can see we have a card
for game over over here and if we click
on this restart button you can see the
page is reloading again and again
so it's working totally fine we'll move
back to the CSS file and we'll
remove this fine
save it now and let's go back to the
JavaScript part
now we'll access two more HTML elements
that we just created so what we'll do is
will
right here where
result is equals
document dot get element by ID and the
ID is
a result fine and then finally we'll
write here where text is equals to
document dot get element by ID
and ID is
text fine so the next thing we'll do is
we'll write here where jumping
is equals to 0 we'll take another
variable for the bird to jump
now we'll need all these elements
further in the video now we have to
create functions for falling and we have
to mention the conditions for game over
as well so what we'll do is we'll write
here after this Reynold function
we'll write here where fall
is equals to
set interval will set an interval so
we'll write here
function
and then we have the body of this
function
so
the next thing we'll do is we'll write
here where
bird top
is equals to percent
will write your window
Dot
get computed style and will pass bird
here
then we'll write here dot get
property value and property value will
be
top fine
foreign
will write here if
jumping
is equals 2 is equals to zero
the body of if statement will write here
bird dot style dot top is equals to bird
top
plus 2
after this will make them in pixels fine
no
we have to mention the time in
milliseconds here so we'll write here 10
and we are good to go so here in this
function we are using the Top Value
provided to the bird so we have used
these two functions
window.getcomputed style and get
property value to get the elements style
property with IDs bird and the Top Value
we need will be passed to the following
function the value of jumping is zero so
the style dot top will be set to birth
top plus 2 pixels now the initial value
was 100 pixels from the top and two
pixels will be added to the value after
every 10 milliseconds now
save it
and here you can see a bird will fall
eventually
fine so what's happening here is
two pixels will be added to this value
of top after every 10 milliseconds now
fine now we have to define those
conditions here wherein we'll check if
the bird touches the ground then game
over for that we have to write inside
the same function only so we'll move
back to a function and we'll write
inside this particular function only
we'll write here where block left
will take the left value of block
and we'll write here percent window Dot
get computed style so we need the
computed Style
for block now
and we'll write here dot get
property value
fine so we'll write here
left because we need the left value
and the value will be stored inside
block left and then we have where
hooltop
fine we'll write here percent window Dot
get computed style we'll write a whole
and then we'll write here get
property value and we'll write here
top
fine
now what we'll do is we'll write here
where
H top so this is another variable so the
value of H top will be
500 plus
hold up so any value return to the whole
top variable will be added to 500 and
that value will be assigned to H top
variable
fine
now we have to write here conditions so
the conditions will be if birdtop is
greater than 450 or block left
we've made a mistake here
we have to put one more bracket over
here and then we'll write your block
left
is less than 50.
and then
we'll write here block left
greater than minus 50.
then we have bird top
is less than H top over top
is greater than H top
Plus 100.
fine
I'll explain it to you in a moment
now what we have to do is we have to
write here result dot Style
dot display we have to change this style
to
block now which was none till now so
then we'll write here text Dot
inner text
is equals to
foreign
now the next thing we'll do is we'll
write here game
dot style Dot
display is equals to
none which was block until now the last
thing we have to do is we have to change
the value of score to zero again so that
the game will restart from zero
now let me explain this to you guys so
we have to write here but top first not
body up
so now if birdtop is greater than 450
means that the bird is touching the
ground or we can say the bottom part of
the container now you can get all these
values correct by going through the
inspect elements and I hope you guys
already know how to use it in JavaScript
to get the exact values in pixels so I
want you guys to check it to cross check
it once if it's fine or not
now if the block left is less than 50
and greater than minus 50 means if the
bird is colloiding with the block or not
and the bird top is less than H top
means the bird is hitting with the top
of the block or the bottom of the hole
we can say
the last one is for the bird to color it
from the upper part of the block
now in all these cases the result box
will appear and the style of the result
box will be blocked
the paragraph tag with IDs text will
show the score here and the game dot
style will change to none now the game
will disappear and the game over
scenario will come forward now score
will be again 0 as if the user wants to
restart the game then he can restart it
from zero again
so save it once and let's see if it's
working or not
save it
and go to the browser
close it
okay
you can see it's working totally fine
but it says your final score is dollar
score so we have made a mistake over
here
now what we'll do is we'll go back here
and we'll check what's wrong here fine
okay the mistake here is of single
inverted comma instead of single
inverted comma we have to put this sign
over here
now save it
go back to the browser restart the game
and you can see it's working totally
fine it says your final score is zero
restart it again and here you can see
it's working totally fine now we are
left with only one thing and that thing
is quite easy so what we have to do now
is we have to make the bird jump on
button press so we have to create one
last function for this event so what
we'll do is we'll write here after this
window
dot add event listener
will add an event key down
and then we'll write here
hop so hop will be a function
is basically a synonym for jump as well
so we'll Define this hop function now
we'll write here
function hop and then we have the body
of this function so jumping
will set to 1
on calling this function and we'll write
here where
bird top
is equals
to percent
will again write here
window dot get computed Style
and the style will get from bird
and the property we want is
top
fine
now I will write here if
but top
is greater than 6
then we'll write here
bird dot Style
dot top
minus 60.
fine
okay so we'll write here
is equals to
but
top
minus 60
so we'll put all this inside a bracket
and we'll convert it to pixels so for
that we have to write here pixels inside
double inverted comma
fine
now what we have to do next is
we have to write here
set timeout
and we have to create
an anonymous function over here
so we'll write here function and we'll
again set the value of jumping to
0 after every
100 milliseconds fine so every time a
key is pressed the Hop function will be
called and the value of jumping will
change to 1 it will again take the birth
of value and check if the value of bird
top is greater than 6 and if yes then
subtract 60 from it and save it inside
the top of the bird then again the bird
will try to go down after every 100
milliseconds but the word will also go
up by 60 pixels on each button press
right now save it and our game is ready
so we are done with creating the game
now what we'll do is we'll go to the
browser and we'll restart the game
so here you can see our bird is jumping
and we can take the butt from the holes
so here you can see
we have a bird and it's working
fine
so we have to take the bird through
these holes so here you can see it says
your final score is zero every time fine
so let's check out for this ones okay so
we have forgot to mention here
score plus plus now save it
go back to the browser
now we'll play this game again once
so we have to take this bird through
these gaps in between the blocks
see how long it goes so here you can see
it says your final score is five and
then again the value of score is set to
0 after some time that's because if the
person want to restart the game then the
value of score will be 0 for that
restart now here you guys just saw me
playing this exciting game and I want
you guys to try it it's fun and you'll
enjoy the game more after creating it by
yourself so we are done with our first

we'll create a car game in which we have
to save a car from obstacles coming
towards our vehicle I don't know the
exact name for this game but let me give
you an overview of this game real quick
so here's the game you can see over the
screen wherein we have a red car on the
road and we have to protect this car by
moving to the left or right all we have
to do is to protect this red car from
collision with the blue one now I know
the graphics for these games are not too
much appealing but if you want to make a
high-end Graphics game then JavaScript
is not the only language you can use we
have to use many different JS libraries
and maybe several other programming
languages along with JavaScript to
achieve this task
so let's focus on these small games for
now and we'll go ahead step by step
now in this particular game if you see
here we have three images one is of red
car the other one is of blue car and a
road behind them right so let's move on
to the programming part directly and
most of the parts will remain the same
like that of Flappy Birds let's move on
to vs code
so here is a game this is the HTML file
and then we have a CSS file and a
Javascript file for this game
now what we'll do first is we'll create
a div tag we have to protect a block
right we have to move the container
either to the left or to the right so
for that we have to create div text so
first of all we'll write here
div we'll take this particular div tag
for the game and we'll write here
another div with IDs game fine now we
have two div tags over here now what
we'll do first is We'll add images for
red car and for blue car right so what
we'll do is we'll take two div tags and
we'll write here ID as blue car
for the blue car and then we'll write
here
IMG
SRC The Source will be
Blue Dot PNG so we have a file named
Blue Dot PNG which is actually an image
and what we'll do is we'll write here
alt so the alternate will be
blue car fine
we copy this piece of code and we'll do
the same for red vehicle as well so
instead of blue car we'll name the ID as
red car
the image source we have in a computer
is Red Dot PNG
and Alternate will be
red card fine
now we have added the two cars to our
div Tech or we can say to a HTML file
save it go to the browser so this is our
document you can see here we have a blue
car and we have a red car you can see we
have both images over here but the size
is different the blue car looks big and
the red one is pretty small right not to
worry we'll figure it out in the CSS
part so let's do the rest of the HTML
part here what we'll do is we'll move to
our HTML file again and now one thing
you might have noticed in the game here
is
on collision we are getting a card for
game over so we have to create this div
tag as well so let's finish the HTML
part first what we'll do is we'll write
here div again
and this time the ID will be
result so we are preparing for the game
over part right now what we'll do is
we'll write here H1 heading so inside H1
we'll write
game over so let me show you why we are
doing this so if you can see here on
collision we have game overwrite so game
over we have to write here now what
we'll do is we'll write here
game over like this
the next thing we need is the score so
what we'll do is we'll write here p
so we'll use the paragraph tag the ID
will be score
and the score will do in JavaScript part
now what we have to do is we have to add
the restart button as well so for that
we'll write here button
ID is equals to
let's say BTN
and we'll use the on click event so on
click will write here
location Dot
reload
we'll call this function so this is a
built-in function in JavaScript what
this function will do is it will refresh
the whole page fine the game will start
again
so we have added another div tag for the
score here we have a heading game over
and a paragraph with ID as score and
then we have a button to reload the web
page
now let's style these elements and make
them look like a game so what we'll do
is we'll move to the CSS file now here's
a CSS file will
first write here some code for the whole
HTML document so for inside this we'll
Define margin
and the default margin will be zero
similarly we'll Define padding as well
so the default padding will also be zero
now
the next thing we have to do is we have
to write here some code for the body
fine here what we'll do is we'll use two
colors at a specific angle of 45 degrees
we have already been through the webkit
linear gradient property in the previous
game which is Flappy Bird so what we'll
do is we'll write here let's take a
background color let's say the
background color is this kind of sky
blue now the next thing we'll do is
we'll take a background image and inside
this we'll write
webkit linear gradient we have already
been through this in the previous game
so we'll write a 45 degree this is the
angle and then we'll Define two colors
here
so our two colors will be
Gray
and the next one will also be gray but a
little bit different from this one so
we'll write here 45 percent it will take
45 percent of the screen and then we'll
write here hash so this is the code for
dark gray color and it will take the
rest 55 percent of the screen fine save
it for now go to the web browser so you
can see here we have two different
colors present over here in a web
browser the colors are divided at an
angle of 45 degree what we can do here
is we can write here
50 50 instead for both the colors
save it now move to the browser and here
you can see you can clearly Spot the
Difference here so here you can see
these two colors are different now
we'll leave it here you can do this
thing as you wish so moving ahead we'll
write here min
height will be
800 pixels fine save it now move to the
browser and here you can see we have a
background color set for this particular
web page
now
so after the body tag we'll do some
styling for the game container so here
you can see we have the IDS game for the
first div tag so what we'll do is we'll
write here
game will
will write some properties here we'll
write here height so the height will be
500 pixels
then we'll write here
width the width of the box is let's say
300 pixels
and the Border will also Define so the
Border will be black
and
border will be one pixel thick
solid and black in color fine save it
you can see over here
so we can't see anything for now so
let's style this first completely
what we'll do is we'll write here margin
so the margin will be
one ram
Auto
now
right here we'll write background image
so the background image is the one we
already have in a folder the name for
that image is road1.png
now we'll write here background
size so we'll write here contain to fit
this image inside the container and
we'll write here overflow
as hidden fine
save it
move to the browser and here you can see
now we have a div tag present over here
we have a container over here and we
have the blue image only for now now
what we'll do next is
we'll style these images as well so
first we'll do the same for blue car
we'll write here
blue car
and inside this we'll write
height as 100 pixels
width will be 130 pixels so there's a
specific reason behind writing this 130
pixel we'll understand it later now the
background color for this car will be
let's say blue for the blue one
and we'll write here
position
so the position will be
relative
next up we'll write here top
top will be 0 pixels so remember the
value for these properties we'll need
them later in the JavaScript part
now what we'll do next is we'll write
here left as
0 pixels
now next up we'll write here text align
as Center
end
animation so this animation we have
already been through it now what we'll
do is we'll write here move
after one second the animation should be
linear
and it should be infinite fine
now this animation we have to Define but
before that we'll write here blue car
IMG so
here what we'll do is we'll Define the
height of image
we'll write a height as 100 pixels
fine now save this go to the browser and
here you can see we have a blue car
present at the top left corner of a
container now what we'll do is we'll
Define the
animation for this particular div tag
right so here is a car present at the
top left corner so what we'll do is
we'll move this box to the middle of the
screen so we have already done it I
guess but there is some mistake
so here you can see we have given space
between one ram save it now
and here you can see we have a box
present at the center of a screen
now we are good to go next up we'll
Define the animation so we'll write here
at the rate
keyframe
and instead of identifier the identifier
we have here is
move
fine
so inside this wheel right here zero
percent at zero percent
the top will be zero fine zero pixels
and at hundred percent the top will be
501 pixels
fine
now one thing to notice here is
the total height of the container is 500
pixels and the animation will go till
501 pixels save it now
move to the browser and here you can see
the car is still not moving so we have
made a mistake here so here's a mistake
we have to write here move only save it
now
and here you can see the animation is
going swiftly now so the car starts from
0 pixel and goes till 501 pixel so it
will happen infinitely because we have
used a infinite inside the animation
property
what we'll do next is we'll do the same
for
red car as well fine so here you can see
we have a red car the ID is red car for
this so what we'll do is we'll write
here
hash red car and we'll start styling
this red car as well the height will
remain the same the height will be 100
pixels and then we have the width
the width will be 130 pixels for this
car as well the background color will be
red because the car color is also red
Position will be relative for this as
well
the top will be 250 pixels let's say and
the left will be 130 pixels fine now
what we are doing here is we are taking
the left as 130 pixels why so because
what we want is we want the car to be
present at 130 pixels away from the left
corner of the box so that's why we have
written 130 pixels over here inside the
left property
now the next thing we'll write here is
text align and text align will be Center
fine
we'll do the same thing for red car as
well here we'll write here red car
IMG
we have to write here hash as well
now inside this we'll Define the height
of this image we'll write here height as
100 pixels fine
save it now go to the browser and here
you can see we have a red and blue car
over here now the Box seems to be a
little bit less wide for these two cars
so what we'll do is we'll write the
width here as 390 pixels so that it will
be divided equally in three parts save
it now
and here you can see now this box looks
totally fine we have a red car present
in the center we can move it to the left
and to the right
so we are done with styling these three
images next up we have to style the
result part as well right so here you
can see in this particular game we have
a card over here with a different
background the game over color is white
and this color is gray I guess the
button color is black and the restart
color is
sky blue fine so we have to keep all
these things in mind we have to style
this box as well so what we'll do is
we'll write here
result
and inside this we'll write
height height will be 200 pixels for
this box
then we'll write here
width
and width will be 400 pixels so we want
a rectangle for this
next up we'll write here background
color
so let's define the RGB value
the RGB value for this particular color
is 231
comma 105 comma
105.
that's because we want to make the exact
same game so that's why we are using the
RGB values here save it now move to the
browser
and here you can see we have the game
over card over here and the game over
color is black and the card color is
pinkish we can say
now we'll move to a CSS file we'll write
here
margin and the margin will be
1 Ram Auto
next up we'll write here
border radius so we want the box to be a
little bit round from the edges so for
that we'll write here border radius is
20 pixels
and then we have
font size is
30 pixels for game over
then we'll write here
text align we want to align the text at
the center of this box
game over color will be white fine so
we'll write here white and we are done
with it save it
and here you can see we have a box over
here we have a game over card over here
now what we want is we want to hide this
thing right so for that we have to write
here
display as none save it now and you can
see we don't have this game over box
over here anymore now moving back to our
CSS file what we'll do is we'll remove
this particular statement for now save
it and here's a box again will add this
property later so for now what we'll do
is we'll write here
score
now what we have to do is we have to
write here font
size
as
2.2 Ram I hope you guys must have
searched for the ram keyword now we'll
discuss this keyword again in the next
video
so for now we'll write here
color and the color will be
let's say
take any color of your choice
so we'll write here gray
or we can say let's take golden node I
don't know which color is it but let's
take it once save it
and you are not getting anything over
here because we haven't defined it yet
so we'll see it later now the last thing
we have to do here is with the button
right so we'll use the button ID for
that we'll write here BTN and inside
this will write padding so padding will
be 0.5 frame
and
one ram for left now we'll write here
border radius for this button is 20
pixels because the button is a little
bit round at the corners
next up we'll write here
border is none we don't need any border
for this particular button
then we'll write here background color
is let's say
black
will write here the color is
which color we should take let's take
this one
now we'll write here margin
top so let's say the margin top will be
10 pixels next up will right here cursor
so cursor will be
pointer fine cursor will change to
pointer on taking it over the restart
button
will write here
text transform we want to transform this
text to uppercase
fine save it now move back to the
browser and here you can see we have a
game over here but this tag is not
working for now
so let's see what's wrong here
okay so we have to write here restart
save it now
and here you can see we have a button
over here we have a restart button over
here the button looks a little bit small
so what we have to do is we have to do
some styling change here we'll take
let's say the font size
so we'll write here
font size is let's say 25 pixels
save it now
and here you can see the button is quite
right now
so we are done with it what we'll do is
we'll add the display property here
we'll write a display none save it
and the box is gone fine now we are done
with the CSS part as well now we have to
make this game responsive only that will
do with the help of JavaScript
so let's move on to the Javascript file
first
here's a Javascript file now we'll
access all the HTML elements here in the
Javascript file because we need them so
what we'll do is we'll write here where
blue car is equals to document
dot get element by ID so the ID for blue
car is
blue car
we'll write here where
red car
document dot get element by ID
so the ID is red car for the red one
next up we'll write here where
a result will get result as well we'll
write your document dot get element by
ID and inside this will write
result fine we are accessing all the
elements with the help of get element by
ID method now what we'll do is we'll
write here where score
so the score will write your document
dot get element by ID and again we'll
write here score
then we'll write here where
game document dot get element by ID the
ID for game is
game
fine
we'll take another variable here let's
say the variable name is variable
counter to count the number of cars
passing through the red one to get the
final score basically so we will
initialize the value as 0 for this
counter variable
now the next thing we have to do is to
make the blue car move randomly in three
positions right for that we'll use math
dot random function again we have used
this function previously in the Flappy
Birds game
so we'll write here blue car dot add
event listener We'll add an event so
we'll write here
animation iteration so this is a
predefined event listener in JavaScript
so for this we'll create a function here
we'll write here function
and will Define the function as well
fine so we'll take a variable let's say
random
and we'll write here math Dot
floor
math dot random
so this is a predefined function in
JavaScript we'll write here into three
and right here will write
130 fine
y130 because 130 is the default width
which we have taken in our CSS file so
we'll write here
blue car dot
tile
dot left
is equals
to the value of random in pixels fine
then we'll increase the value of counter
after every car passes through after
every blue car passes through the red
one save it and move to the browser
you can see
the blue car has three positions over
here it can either come from the left
right or from the center any random
number from these three numbers will get
multiplied to 130 so we have three
positions only any random position let's
say the position is one it means that
the car is present at the left so that
particular number will be multiplied
with 130 and the left value of the blue
car will change to that particular
number
the logic is simple if the number
randomly taken is 2 then the random
value will become 260 in that case and
the blue car will have a distance of 260
pixels from the left side of the
container
so this was the reason behind taking the
width of container is 390 I hope you
guys can relate to it now so let's move
ahead and write the code for moving the
red car as well so you can see the red
car is not moving as of now will make it
move so let's write the code for that as
well
we'll move to a JavaScript file
and we'll write here
window dot add event listener will add
an event here
will write here
key down
and we'll Define a function here fine
so we'll take a parameter inside this
function
now what we'll do is we'll write here if
e Dot
key code
is equals to is equals to
39
and then what will happen is
we'll take a variable where
red car left
is equals to
we'll write here percent
window
Dot
get
computed Style
will get the computed style of
red car
and will right here get
property value fine we'll take the
property value here is we'll take the
left value so we'll write here left
and we'll write here if
red car left
is less than
260 pixels
then
red car
dot style dot left
will change to red car left
Plus
130
and the value will change to pixels as
well fine
now we'll write the code for another key
as well so we have to add two keys over
here what we'll do is
we'll write here if
e Dot key code
is equals to is equals to
37
this key code over here represents the
left and the right arrow key of our
keyboard so that's why we are using here
key code AS 37 and 39. 39 is the default
key code for the right arrow key and 37
is for the left Arrow key
so what we'll do here is we'll write
here where red car left
is equals to percent so what we'll do is
we'll copy this from here
and we'll paste it here fine
this will remain the same
now what we'll do is we'll write here if
red car left is greater than 0
then it will change the
style so we'll write here
this and here what we'll do is we'll
change the value of red car to Red Car
left minus 130 pixels so we are moving
the car to the left or to the right fine
now we are done with it now save it and
move to the browser and now here you can
see we are able to move the red car to
the left or to the right as well fine
now we are good to go so the next thing
we have to do is to write the code for
Collision of these two cars or we can
say the function for game over as well
fine so let's head back to our
Javascript file and we'll create another
function over here so what we'll do is
we'll take certain values and pass them
through some conditions if any of the
requirements fail then the game is over
the logic is simple let's implement this
logic so what we'll do is we'll write
here set interval so we'll use the set
interval method and we'll write here
function so let's say the function name
is
game over will
Now define the body of this function
now let's discuss some things what we
need is we need the top property of blue
car we need the left property of blue
car and then we need the left property
of a red car fine so we'll take three
variables we'll write here where
blue car top
then we'll take where
blue car left and then we'll take where
a red car left
fine
so we have these three variables over
here now what we'll do is we'll write
we'll get these values first so we'll
again use the get computed style
property and the get property value
will write a percent and inside this
will write window Dot
get computed style so the computed style
is of the blue car
then we'll write here
get property value will write here
top because we need the Top Value we'll
do the same thing for blue car left and
for
red car left fine so we'll change the
values here
we'll write here left for the blue car
left
and we'll write here
left
for the
red car
fine
we are good to go we have these three
variables and we have the properties
right we have the value of these
particular properties now we'll write
here certain conditions we'll use the if
statement again
will write here if
blue car left is equals to
red car left
let's replace this left with a capital l
and we'll write here and then blue card
top
is greater than
250
and
blue cart office also less than 450 so
we need the blue car in between 250 and
450 for Collision right what we'll do is
will write here result Dot
tile dot display so we'll change the
display property of a result element
we'll write here
is equals to block now we need a game
over card over the game and we'll also
change the display property of game as
well we'll write here game Dot
style dot display
s
none fine we don't want the game for
this now the next thing we'll do is
we'll write here score so for that we'll
write a score dot inner HTML
is equals to
let's say it says your score is
and we'll write here
dollar we have a variable counter right
we'll print the value of counter here
fine
now there is an error over here you can
see so what we have to do is we have to
put them inside this
will not use
the double inverted commas we'll use
this instead and you can see the error
over here is gone now
so we are good to go now after that
we'll change the value of counter to 0
again in case the user wants to restart
the game the value of counter will start
from 0 again now we want to call this
function after a certain interval of
time so we'll write here 10
and we are good to go so the set
interval method will be called after 10
milliseconds now the same thing we did
for Flappy Birds as well so some
conditions here are almost same and the
output is also the same as we had for
Flappy Birds
now save it and you can see on the
browser that our game is completely fine
now it's working totally fine so we can
play this game
now let's play it once so here you can
see we can move our red car and the blue
car is coming randomly from any of the
three directions it means that it can
either come from the left or from the
center or from the right fine on
collision you can see it shows that the
game is over and the score is 13. now on
clicking the restart button we can
restart the game the page reloads again
and it's working totally fine now
we have to create this particular game
and we can see that the game is
completely done we can play this game
anytime and it's fun as well of course
