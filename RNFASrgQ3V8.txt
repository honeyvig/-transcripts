[Music]

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,320
all right so just before I start the

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,560
actual tutorial today i' just like to

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,800
say that an early access copy of my book

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,000
hello Swift has been released for the

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,880
first eight chapters you can find it on

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,599
many bookstores online such as Amazon

8
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,480
chapters and in the go as well as the

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,680
Publishers website I really do hope that

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,040
this helps you throughout your journey

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,079
of learning the Swift programming

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,160
language all right so let's get into the

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,320
tutorial

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,120
now so hello there and welcome to

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,280
another tutorial my name is tamry Baki

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,600
and this time we're going to be going

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,160
over how you can use the breath first

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,680
search algorithm in order to Traverse a

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,559
hierarchical graph or tree now now let's

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,680
actually begin today by saying first of

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,799
all thank you to Nicholas one of my

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,360
subscribers for actually sending in this

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,320
question in fact you can see a picture

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,680
of him on screen right now now Nicholas

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,479
actually originally came to me and

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,799
emailed me with a question that said how

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,840
can you use the AAR algorithm in order

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,600
to Traverse a an arbitrary graph or a

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,159
hierarchical graph uh and so I thought

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,960
that okay this would be a great video

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,600
idea and so I started doing some

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,040
research SE Arch but I realized

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
eventually that it's actually slightly

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,720
harder to let the AAR algorithm uh

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,880
Traverse a hierarchical graph than it is

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,399
to have AAR Traverse a maze something

37
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,240
like this is harder to use AAR with than

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,040
to do things like a maze and in fact you

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,439
can see a link to a video where I tell

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,920
you how to use the AAR algorithm with a

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,439
maze in the description below um and the

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,159
reason it's so hard is because you can't

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,320
just directly say okay what's the

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,840
distance between Toronto to Milton over

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,600
here on this little graph

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,280
uh you'd have to calculate it using

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,079
another uh using another algorithm but

48
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,280
we'll get into that later but now you're

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,119
probably wondering well what is this

50
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,879
well today I'm going to be using the

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,080
question that Nicholas asked me and I'm

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,879
going to be answering it using this

53
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,280
graph now I've actually created this

54
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,200
graph and this graph essentially

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,879
highlights uh a few of Ontario cities uh

56
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,599
very very few of them they're very

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,560
they're I guess you could say in the

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
greater Toronto area

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,360
uh and near Toronto uh in Canada uh and

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,640
so we have cities here like marham vaugh

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,560
Bramton msaga Oakville Burlington hton

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,159
Hills Aurora and more uh and so

63
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,360
basically what we're going to be doing

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,200
here uh is as you can see I've actually

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,480
highlighted in kilometers the distance

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,319
between any two cities that are

67
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,879
connected by Road um but there's one

68
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,480
small problem these distance values

69
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,680
aren't distance values based off of

70
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,400
Roads these are distance values from the

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,280
latitude and L longitude of from the

72
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,599
center of Toronto to the latitude and

73
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,239
longitude of the center of vau for

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,599
example uh the reason I'm doing this is

75
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,120
because I didn't want any complications

76
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,280
where the roads go through other cities

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,400
uh and that's the length that we're

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,680
taking so in basically skipping all of

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,959
that these are the kilometer distance

80
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,640
values between cities that are connected

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,760
by road but instead of getting the road

82
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,720
distance we get the air distance from

83
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,360
the centers of those respective

84
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,040
cities um that's basically what this

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,159
graph consists of in fact since this is

86
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,640
a little bit small to have on the

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,959
Whiteboard and we're going to need a lot

88
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,400
of whiteboard space to go through the

89
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,239
algorithm what I'm going to do is

90
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,480
throughout this video I'm going to have

91
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,200
this actually popping up on the video

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,799
screen so you can take a look at what

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,519
I'm talking about in fact there's

94
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,920
actually going to be a link to this

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,519
graph in the description below so what

96
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,239
I'd recommend you do is you open up half

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,519
of this on your screen and half of the

98
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,760
actual video so you can take a look at

99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,200
exactly what I'm saying in bit more to

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,920
tail and stay in sync with what's

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
actually on the graph if you wouldn't

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,200
like to do that though don't worry I

103
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,599
will be showing the graph throughout the

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,720
video in intervals all right let's begin

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,799
now today what my goal is is to show you

106
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,359
how you can use the Brett's first search

107
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,519
algorithm to Traverse to from Toronto to

108
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,800
Aurora now there's another question you

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,880
might be wondering and well why is the

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,199
breath for search algorithm named the

111
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,080
breath for search algorithm well it's

112
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
quite simple the breett ver search

113
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
algorithm will actually check a nodes

114
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
neighbors before checking that those

115
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,360
nodes neighbors neighbors uh basically

116
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,240
what's going to happen is it's going to

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,960
check its own surroundings before

118
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,560
checking the surroundings of its own

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,000
surroundings uh unlike how the AAR

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,720
algorithm work Works uh and so in some

121
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,919
cases I guess you could say the breath

122
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,000
for search algorithm is sometimes more

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,960
efficient in some cases the AAR

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,759
algorithm is more efficient but that's a

125
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,320
topic for an entire different video for

126
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,440
now though I'm going to be showing you

127
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
how exactly we can use the breath for

128
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,560
search algorithm in order to Traverse a

129
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,000
hierarchical graph however soon in the

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
future I will also create a video of how

131
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,280
you can use the AAR algorithm to do this

132
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,600
as well and how you can use the breath

133
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,759
first search algorithm in order to

134
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,080
Traverse a maze so I'm going to be

135
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,840
creating a lot more pathfinding videos

136
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,680
in the near future as well all right but

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,039
let's begin so now as you can see uh on

138
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,600
the graph screen right now uh we've got

139
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,840
two cities Toronto and Aurora and we've

140
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,400
got a few cities in between these two

141
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,440
cities and we want to find the shortest

142
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,520
way to get from Toronto to Aurora uh by

143
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,680
going through some cities uh and so the

144
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,360
way we can do this is by first of all we

145
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,479
note down Toronto Okay

146
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,280
so we've got Toronto noted

147
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,800
down now where all does Toronto take us

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,919
where all can we go directly from

149
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,240
Toronto

150
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,199
on this graph so what we do is we draw

151
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,240
an arrow and we say okay we can go from

152
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,880
Toronto to marham Von Bramton and Miss

153
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Saga okay but if you take a look at the

154
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,280
graph on screen you see that Miss Saga

155
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,759
is 22 km away rington is 32 km away Mark

156
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,840
is 24 and vau is 24 as well and so miss

157
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,680
Saga is the least distant from Toronto

158
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,199
then Markham and vaugh and then Bramton

159
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,360
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

160
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,639
list it in that order Miss Saga Markham

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,400
Von

162
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Bramton so miss

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,840
Saga

164
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,440
Markham

165
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,319
V

166
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
Bron okay now sometimes since like M

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,160
repeats for Miss Saga maram Milton and

168
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,479
more I'm just going to put an extra

169
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,039
letter to signify Miss Saga um Markham

170
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,199
ml for Milton and more uh same thing for

171
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,680
Brandon as well

172
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,479
okay so once we've got these down then

173
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,039
we're ready to move on to the next step

174
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:08,440
so we've actually noted down where

175
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,479
Toronto can take us uh and so what we're

176
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,080
going to do now is I'm actually going to

177
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,280
add a little super script to each one of

178
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,720
these and I'm going to say t meaning

179
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,280
Toronto and this means that this node

180
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,160
was visited by Toronto I'll tell you why

181
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,039
this is helpful to us in just a moment

182
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,560
but here's a hint we're going to be

183
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,520
backtracking how we were actually able

184
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,479
ble to get to our destination and these

185
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,800
superscripts will be extremely helpful

186
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,879
in a programming sense what would happen

187
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,520
is let's say you've got Ms as a node

188
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,759
class You' have a came from variable or

189
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,080
something of that sort which is another

190
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,759
node and that's where you would store

191
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,159
the superscript that's how you would

192
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,960
implement it but this is how we're going

193
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,840
to show it on the

194
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,919
Whiteboard so once you have drawn this

195
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,960
out then we're ready to move on to the

196
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,240
next step which is seeing well where can

197
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,120
these four nodes take us then uh so if I

198
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,280
continue

199
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,759
here as you can

200
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,319
see what we're going to do here is let's

201
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,759
take a look first of all at Misa Saga

202
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,879
but one last thing we do we need to do

203
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,080
before we move on to the next step is

204
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,759
over our superscript for Toronto let's

205
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,960
make another superscript that notes down

206
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,199
the distance between these two nodes so

207
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,960
Mrs to Toronto is

208
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,479
22 then this is 24 oh sorry

209
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
not M it's 24 so markam to Toronto and

210
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,519
Von Toronto are both 24 so I'm going to

211
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,360
note down 24 and

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,800
24 uh and then for Brandon we've got

213
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
32 all

214
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,040
right so now that we've noted this all

215
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,959
down we're ready to move on to the next

216
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,480
step so our next step is going to be and

217
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,040
also just so you don't get confused I'm

218
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,600
going to draw a quick Green Line that'll

219
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,440
signify

220
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,120
this is one set and now we're working on

221
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,040
our second set of

222
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,720
nodes

223
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,640
okay all right so let's begin now miss

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
Saga where can miss Saga take us to so

225
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,240
let's actually note down Miss Saga on

226
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,480
the side of our whiteboard over here and

227
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
we know that Miss Saga can take us too

228
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,519
and you can see the graph on screen

229
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,040
right now it can take us to Oakville it

230
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,040
can take us to Milton it can take us to

231
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,120
Halton Hills it can take us to Bramton

232
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
and it can also take us right back to

233
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,800
Toronto uh and also by the way in case

234
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,880
you were wondering uh you can see that

235
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,480
there's some arrows between these nodes

236
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,279
as well like for example there's an

237
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,920
arrow between the connection that goes

238
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,200
from Toronto to miss Saga and that Arrow

239
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,959
points from Toronto to miss Saga however

240
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,399
another thing I'd like to note is that

241
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
these arrows don't really mean anything

242
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,320
this is like bidirectional you can go

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,079
from Toronto to Mississippi using this

244
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,839
route and from Miss Saga to Toronto

245
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,880
using this route these these arrowheads

246
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,160
mean practically nothing at this point

247
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,519
uh But continuing so now we know that

248
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,519
Mrs sag can take us to Oakville Milton

249
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,519
hton Hills branches and Toronto now if

250
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,320
you take a look in these two lists here

251
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,440
and not the list that we've already

252
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,640
created because it's blank anyway uh if

253
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,839
you take a look at these two lists

254
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,040
Toronto is already in

255
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,440
one so we remove it Brandon is also

256
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,600
already in the list Milton is not opal

257
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,440
is not and hton Hills is

258
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,160
not so we know that we cannot re-include

259
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,279
brandton and Toronto in our new list so

260
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,360
we of course erase those but hton Hills

261
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,839
Oakville and Milton do seem like good

262
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,720
candidates so let's actually not down

263
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,519
their distance value so Oakville is 14

264
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,560
km from Miss Saga Milton is 21 and hton

265
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,000
Hills would be 31 and these are actually

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,320
perfect and the reason these are AB

267
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,480
absolutely perfect uh is because these

268
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,880
are already in order so 14 21 31 so all

269
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,079
we need to do now is erase

270
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,839
these and then go back to our list over

271
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,240
here and say

272
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Oakville which comes from Miss

273
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,000
Saga all right and since Oakville comes

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,560
from Miss Saga we're going to note down

275
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,880
its distance value we're also going to

276
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,200
say Milton here

277
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,800
which comes from Miss Saga uh and this

278
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,639
is 21

279
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,040
km from Miss Saga then we've got hton

280
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
Hills which is from Miss Saga and this

281
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,959
is 31 km

282
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,440
away all right so we've noted these down

283
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,120
and they are in order for Miss Saga now

284
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,880
let's take a look at how Markham handles

285
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,839
this so let's

286
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,040
begin sorry uh so Markham uh as you can

287
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,680
see I want to note this down and we've

288
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,800
got Markham over here now Markham can

289
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,680
take us to Richmond

290
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,360
Hill it can take us to vaugh and it can

291
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,560
take us back to Toronto that's it now

292
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,680
vaugh and Toronto are already part of

293
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,120
this list so we cannot include those

294
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
however Richmond Hill has not yet been

295
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,360
included in any of these lists so what

296
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,680
I'm going to do is I'm going to add a

297
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,199
comma and we're going to say in this new

298
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:28,120
list we're going to add Richmond Hill

299
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,920
that comes from

300
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,760
Markham uh and this is a 8 km distance

301
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,680
uh and so that's how we know that down

302
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,240
uh then we are done working with Markham

303
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,199
so we can remove this little area of our

304
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,560
whiteboard then finally we can take a

305
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,279
look at V so now van has quite a few

306
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,360
different cities that it connects to so

307
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,120
V does marham

308
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,279
Toronto uh V's Richmond Hill again

309
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,800
uh vau does

310
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,399
King V does kadan and it does

311
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,800
Bramton quite a few it quite a few

312
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,880
different cities uh so now let's take a

313
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,440
look at this so Markham already exists

314
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,800
in this set Toronto already exists in

315
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
the first set Richmond Hill I'll talk

316
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,279
about in a moment King does not already

317
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,920
exist kaladin does not exist but Bramton

318
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,720
does so we've narrowed it down to

319
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,320
Richmond Hill King and

320
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,199
kaladan but then you take a look and say

321
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,040
hey but wait Richmond Hill already

322
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,000
exists in this set well we don't remove

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,480
this Richmond Hill oh sorry we don't

324
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,560
remove this new Richmond Hill just yet

325
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,040
what happened is like for example

326
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,000
Markham marham wasn't in this set but it

327
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,279
was in this set and this set well sorry

328
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,120
it was in a set before this one and so

329
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,560
what we do is we take a look at okay if

330
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,839
Markham or this node was in a set before

331
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,600
this one then we cannot re-include it in

332
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,160
the new set

333
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,199
however Richmond Hill isn't in a set for

334
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,040
this one it is in this set and so what

335
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,480
we're going to do is we're going to take

336
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,160
a look at both of these Richmond Hills

337
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,639
uh in the first Richmond Hill we're

338
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,600
going to take a look at how far away it

339
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,639
actually is from Toronto and the way

340
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,959
we're going to do this is by using these

341
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,279
super scripts I mentioned so if we take

342
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,959
a look over here this Richmond Hill in

343
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,000
the current set ignore this

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,079
one currently we go Richmond Hill to

345
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,399
where did Richmond Hill come from from

346
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,920
Markham so we go to Markham where did

347
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,480
Markham come from Markham came from

348
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,680
Toronto okay and what's the distance

349
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,279
between Richmond Hill and Markham that's

350
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,480
8 km and what's the distance between

351
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,959
Markham and Toronto as you can see that

352
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,639
is 24

353
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,079
km then we just add 8 and

354
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,199
24 and then we get a good uh that would

355
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,399
be

356
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,320
32 all right so we've got 8 + 24 that's

357
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,120
32 so in total from Richmond Hill to

358
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,759
Toronto using these superscripts as you

359
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,920
can see that's a 32 km

360
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,240
distance now if I were to take a look at

361
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,160
this new Richmond Hill that's in the

362
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,120
vonet let's take a look so Richmond

363
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,680
Hill in the new one goes to vaugh and

364
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,320
then this vaugh goes to Toronto is our

365
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,360
plan now vanau to Toronto distance is 24

366
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,040
km and Richmond Hill to vanau distance

367
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,800
is 7 and when we add 7 and

368
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
24 we get

369
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,560
31 and so as you can

370
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,079
see if we were to include the Richmond

371
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,279
Hill from the vaugh set and not the

372
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,600
Richmond Hill from the Markham set then

373
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,480
we would have a shorter path we have a

374
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,560
shorter path meaning a less number of

375
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,759
kilometers to get back to Toronto from

376
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,920
Richmond Hill and so what we're going to

377
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,680
do is since we've decided that the

378
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,120
Richmond Hill from the Von set is

379
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,319
shorter than the Richmond Hill from the

380
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,040
Markham set I'm actually going to erase

381
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,279
this Richmond

382
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,399
Hill and in place I am going to uh of

383
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,720
course replace this with Richmond Hill

384
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,880
from vgh and this is a 7 km

385
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,079
distance there we go then we can erase

386
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,759
all this extra work that we've done over

387
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,759
here

388
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,759
okay all

389
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,319
right so we're done with that that but

390
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,600
then we see we also have the king and

391
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,800
kaladan uh over here so we take a look

392
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,120
at King so King is how many kmers away

393
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,279
he 16 km away but kaladan is only 29 km

394
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,360
away so of course we know that King

395
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,319
comes after Kaled King comes before

396
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:50,240
kaladan in our final set so we note down

397
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,279
that we have King from vaugh with a 16

398
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,720
km distance uh and we've also got

399
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,720
kaledon from vau uh and this is a 29 km

400
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,000
distance uh and then we are done with

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,280
our V set and we can erase this van

402
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,240
information from

403
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,199
here but then finally in this set over

404
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,039
here we've got Bramton and bmon is our

405
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,439
last node uh and so what I'm going to do

406
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,160
is we're going to take bmon

407
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,720
here okay where does Bron take us to

408
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,799
well again quite a few cities so Bron

409
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,880
can take us to kaladan on Toronto it can

410
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
take us to hton Hills and it can take us

411
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,360
to miss Saga now of course we can see

412
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,840
that V already in one of our older lists

413
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,480
Toronto is already in one of our older

414
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
lists Halton the hills we'll talk about

415
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
in a minute Mrs Saga already in our

416
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,799
older list kaladin we will talk about in

417
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,240
a minute as well now let's talk let's

418
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,600
start by talking a little bit about

419
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,120
cadan so as you can see over here our

420
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,919
older path with kaladan what would

421
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,200
happen here is we would go from kaladan

422
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,960
to

423
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,640
vaugh and this was a 29 kilometer

424
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,720
distance and then from vaugh to Toronto

425
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,520
which was a 24 kilom distance and so the

426
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,600
distance between uh from from the from

427
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,240
the older kaladan already in our set to

428
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,679
Toronto uh would be 29 + 24 and that

429
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,120
would be 29 24 uh so we would

430
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,960
do 53 km apart uh and so what we should

431
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
do now though is let's just take a look

432
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,240
at our new cadin so our new cadin uh

433
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,520
over here so our kaladin to Brampton

434
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,799
distance would be 15

435
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,960
km then our Brandon Toronto distance

436
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,880
would be uh oh sorry I wrote Toronto in

437
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,240
the wrong place uh but our brand to

438
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,280
Toronto distance would be I can actually

439
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,440
check that from the super script that

440
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,880
we've already written and that's why

441
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,520
it's so useful uh 32

442
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,600
km 32 to Toronto

443
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,760
so now if we add those up though so 15

444
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,760
32 we've got 47 so as you can see the

445
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,600
distance between kaladan to Toronto

446
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,080
through brandton is actually shorter

447
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,760
than kaladin to Toronto through vau uh

448
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,559
and so what I'm going to do uh is as you

449
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,480
know we are going to take kaladan and we

450
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,799
are going to erase it and do an inplace

451
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,159
replacement uh meaning it stays in the

452
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,320
same uh it stays in the same um I guess

453
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,919
you would say element it stays the same

454
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,240
element uh in the array it stays the

455
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,720
same index sorry in the array uh however

456
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,480
we just change its value so kaladan

457
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
comes from

458
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,960
Bramton with a 15 km

459
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,919
distance all right so once that's done

460
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,840
we can oh one more we've got hton Hills

461
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,600
then we can also of course erase our

462
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,640
work for kaladan

463
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,760
all

464
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,240
right so now let's take a look at our

465
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,200
older hton Hills so hton Hills currently

466
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,840
goes through Miss Saga and then from

467
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,640
Miss Saga to Toronto so if we were to

468
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,679
write hton

469
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,200
Hills to miss Saga which is a 31 km

470
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,760
distance then from Miss Saga to Toronto

471
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,559
and that is a 22 km distance uh if we

472
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,280
were to add those up so 3122

473
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,320
uh we've got 53 km again so hton Hills

474
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,039
is currently 53 km uh away from uh

475
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,520
Toronto through Miss Saga but if we were

476
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,520
to by chance you know replace hton Hills

477
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,360
with Bramton oh sorry Miss Saga with

478
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,559
Bramton and go through Bramton for hton

479
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,919
Hills to get to Toronto what would

480
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,640
happen is let's say our hton Hills to

481
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,520
Bron distance uh is 23

482
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,320
km uh sorry

483
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,360
so our hton Hill to Bramton distance

484
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,840
would be let's just make sure yeah

485
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,400
that's 23 km as you can see on screen

486
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,039
right now then brandton 2 Toronto as I

487
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,760
noted before would be 32 and so as you

488
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,400
can see uh if we were to add those up

489
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,320
23 on

490
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,880
32 as you can see that would be 55 but

491
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,720
currently we've got a 53 distance so if

492
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,120
we were to replace Miss Saga with Bron

493
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,960
uh as the thorough far for hton to

494
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
Toronto uh we would be we would be uh

495
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
driving 2 more kilomet and so we're not

496
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,840
going to replace hton Hills and so we

497
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,279
know it's not worth it to go through

498
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,799
Bron to get from hton hills to Toronto

499
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,600
or from Toronto to hton Hills and so we

500
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,919
can of course erase our work for Brandon

501
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,440
as we know we're not replacing hton

502
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,679
Hills now and we are done with the next

503
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,679
step but we still haven't reached our

504
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,480
destination yet we want to reach Aurora

505
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,960
which is another city uh and so in order

506
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,320
to get there we've got to do a few more

507
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,960
steps uh so what we're going to do now

508
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,039
is I'm going to once again create a

509
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,960
little separator for you here between

510
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,400
the next set and this current

511
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,640
set and then we can continue

512
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,720
so let's begin with Oakville now where

513
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,799
can Oakville take us uh now if we take a

514
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,880
look at our map though uh and if we were

515
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,159
to draw out temporarily Oakville takes

516
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,840
us to uh I'm just going to see here so

517
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,400
it takes us to

518
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,840
Burlington it takes us to Milton and it

519
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,039
takes us to miss Saga now Milton now of

520
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,960
course this is our new set over here

521
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
this is our new set this is our old set

522
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,000
this is an older set and this is the

523
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,760
oldest set and so this one uh Now look

524
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,039
for example this Oakfield can take us to

525
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,520
Milton but this is already in an older

526
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,360
set and so what we do is we set Milton

527
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,679
won't work neither will Mrs Saga because

528
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,559
that's also in one of the older sets so

529
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,760
Mrs Saga gets crossed out as well so the

530
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,840
only place that Oakville can take us to

531
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
is

532
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,039
Burlington uh and so what we're going to

533
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,200
do is we're going to note down

534
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,120
Burlington uh in our set so Burlington

535
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,279
which comes from Oakville and our

536
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,120
distance between would be 18 km uh and

537
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,799
so once that's done though we can move

538
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,720
on to Milton from our older set over

539
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,600
here now where can Milton take us let's

540
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,679
see so Milton can take us to now again

541
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,480
quite a few cities it can take us to the

542
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,400
hton hills it can take us to Oakville it

543
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,480
can take us to Burlington it can take us

544
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,960
to Mrs Saga uh and so basically what

545
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,159
we're going to say is okay Oakville

546
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,120
already there hton hills already there

547
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,080
missa already there all we've got is

548
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,000
Berlin lington uh now though

549
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Burlington uh is in our new set our

550
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,360
current set I guess you could say and so

551
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,760
we're going to do is we're going to

552
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
calculate the total distance using these

553
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,840
superscripts and so

554
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,200
Burlington currently goes through

555
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,400
Oakville and then Oakville if we take a

556
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
look at our subscript I mean superscript

557
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,559
goes to Mrs Saga which goes to Toronto

558
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,919
now the Mrs Saga to Toronto distance is

559
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,880
22 km the Oakville to miss Saga distance

560
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,720
is 14 and the Burlington to Oakville is

561
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,559
18 so if we were to add these all up 18

562
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,760
I'm just going to draw this a little bit

563
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,520
higher um so we've got our values 18 14

564
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,480
and 22 basically as you can see we've

565
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,880
got a

566
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,760
um 54 km distance here so this is these

567
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,799
are basically Burlington to Toronto or

568
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,880
Toronto to Burlington using Oakfield and

569
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,679
Miss Saga as thorough far you're going

570
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,080
to be going uh you're going to be

571
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,480
driving or flying in this case for 54 km

572
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,520
however this is for our old uh old

573
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,480
Burlington let's just see by chance if

574
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,760
we were to replace um this Oakville with

575
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,279
Milton what would happen is Burlington

576
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,600
would go to Milton which would go to

577
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,919
miss Saga which would go to Toronto

578
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,360
again the Miss Saga to Toronto distance

579
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
stays the same 22 I'll just draw that

580
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,919
slightly clearer for you so you can see

581
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,919
it's a 22 um but since that value stays

582
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,559
the same we don't really care much about

583
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:36,159
that value so 22 Milton to missaka

584
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,679
however uh will stay 21 and then

585
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,679
Burlington to Milton will of course be

586
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:45,120
22 now you can obviously already tell

587
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,760
that this is much higher let's just

588
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,919
still add to make sure so we've got 22

589
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,440
21 and 22 so 22

590
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,039
21 sorry 21 and 22

591
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,760
now as you can see basically we're me to

592
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,120
say five and six so 65 kilm uh so this

593
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,760
is much much more than what our current

594
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,799
Burlington is so we can successfully say

595
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,440
that Burlington should not be replaced

596
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,679
uh I mean Oakfield should not be

597
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,520
replaced with Milton in order to get

598
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,960
from Burlington to Toronto so Milton

599
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,880
cannot offer anything for us to add to

600
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,559
the set and so we erase all of our work

601
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,840
for Milton

602
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,760
there we

603
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,880
go there all right so we're almost half

604
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,880
done and now we take a look at hton

605
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,520
Hills where can hton Hills take us well

606
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,799
let's draw that out so hton Hills uh can

607
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:50,559
currently take us to in total Bramton

608
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,760
kaledon Milton and Mrs

609
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,000
Saga okay uh so now if we take a look

610
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Mrs Saga again is already gone Milton is

611
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,320
already gone kadon is already gone and

612
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,279
bton is already gone so hton Hills can

613
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:08,919
take us nowhere and so hton Hills is

614
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,919
immediately

615
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,760
deleted then we take a look at Richmond

616
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,039
Hill you're probably getting excited now

617
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,919
because it's very close to Aurora let's

618
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,120
actually try this out so Richmond Hill

619
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,279
actually takes us to uh Aurora

620
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,919
it takes us to marham it takes us to

621
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,559
vaugh uh and it takes us to King now

622
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,080
even though we've reached our

623
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,919
destination with this our point is to

624
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,640
not um of course continue basically

625
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,240
we're not going to just stop here and

626
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
say that okay we're done uh because

627
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Richmond Hill takes us to Aurora that's

628
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,760
not going to happen so what we're going

629
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,679
to do is um okay so sorry uh so Markham

630
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,559
is already in our list V is already on

631
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,120
our list uh then King and Aurora aren't

632
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,039
so what we're going to do is we're going

633
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,159
to take a look at King uh and so first

634
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,880
of all uh King and Aurora so Aurora uh

635
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,320
from Richmond Hill is 14 km uh and King

636
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,760
is 16 km so what I'm going to do is I'm

637
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,640
going to add these in this order so

638
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,600
Aurora 14 and King 16 so Aurora comes

639
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,120
from Richmond Hill uh with 14 km of 14

640
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,080
of distance uh and then King comes in uh

641
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,600
to from Richmond

642
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Hill with 16 km of

643
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,960
distance once that is done though

644
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,440
finally uh we can continue now the only

645
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,399
reason that we're not just stopping at

646
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,799
Aurora though uh is because well let's

647
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,320
just say that for example King uh we've

648
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,640
already got King in our set so King can

649
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,559
also take us to Aurora let's just say

650
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,440
that by chance of King is a shorter path

651
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,200
to get to Aurora we don't just want to

652
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,440
stop at Richmond Hill we want to

653
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
continue and see and make sure that none

654
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,440
of our other nodes can take us to Aurora

655
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,240
in a much quicker way uh but one more

656
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,600
thing we have to take a look at is as

657
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,440
you can see I added King to our set but

658
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,880
in our older set we've already got king

659
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,720
so I'm going to remove this King

660
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,240
here all right so now we can continue

661
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,159
continue uh so as you can see we've got

662
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:35,240
this set and we're done with Richmond

663
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,440
Hill then we take a look at King from

664
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,600
our older set so King goes to in total

665
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,480
again quite a two cities it goes to New

666
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,320
Market it goes to kaledon it goes to

667
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,320
Aurora it goes to Richmond Hill and of

668
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,000
course it goes to V now Richmond Hill is

669
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,080
already in our older set V's already in

670
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,960
one of our older sets Aurora I'll talk

671
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,919
about in a minute kadan's already there

672
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,240
and New Market isn't uh so let's take a

673
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,279
look at Aurora first so our current

674
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,600
Aurora goes through Richmond Hill so it

675
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,240
basically goes like this Aurora to

676
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,880
Richmond Hill uh to vaugh H sorry yeah

677
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,399
Richmond Hill to vaugh and then vaugh

678
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,159
finally goes to Toronto now the Von to

679
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,960
Toronto distance is 24 km Richmond Hill

680
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,320
to vaugh is 7 and then aora to Richmond

681
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Hill is 14 okay uh so if we add this all

682
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,399
up 14724

683
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,640
as you can see this basically becomes 5

684
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,039
one here and that's 45 45 km currently

685
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,120
uh if we want to get from Aurora to

686
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,480
Toronto through Richmond Hill and vaugh

687
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,720
however let's just say we were to

688
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,000
replace the Richmond Hill with King what

689
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,799
would happen is we would be going from

690
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,360
Aurora to King and then from King we

691
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,519
would be going to van and then from vgh

692
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,679
sorry we will be going to Toronto this

693
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,440
is 24 km King to would be 16 km and then

694
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,960
Aurora to King would be uh 28 km so if

695
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,200
we were to add 28 16 and 24 as you can

696
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,000
quite obviously tell it will be way way

697
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,200
higher so this would be around um eight

698
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,000
and then one more here uh and so this

699
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,600
would be 68 kilm in total if we were to

700
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,880
go through King and vaugh instead of

701
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,519
Richmond Hill and vaugh and that's why

702
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,639
we are are not going through King and

703
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,960
vaugh and so we know that it's not worth

704
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,279
it to replace this current Aurora path

705
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,000
with the new Aurora path so cing can

706
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
only take us to New Market uh and that

707
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,440
is with a 16 km distance so I'm going to

708
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,600
just note that down it can take us to

709
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,799
New Market from King with uh 16 making

710
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,760
sure yeah 16 kilm distance and then of

711
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,880
course we can erase our work for King

712
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,240
and we are almost done hooray after so

713
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,639
much work just almost done then finally

714
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,159
kaledon so where can kaladan take us

715
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,279
well it can take us to quite a few

716
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:17,120
places so begin kaladan takes us to uh

717
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,919
let's see so it can take us to brandton

718
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,360
hton

719
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,120
Hills it can take us to King and vaugh

720
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,159
got to make sure nothing else and there

721
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,080
we go all right so we can take these

722
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,120
four cities now Bron already in our

723
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,799
older set hton Hills already

724
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,080
um yes sorry uh cadin uh hton Hills

725
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,000
already in a roller set King already in

726
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,559
our older set and vau already in our

727
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:49,080
older set so cadan can take us nowhere

728
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,360
and we are done finding neighbor nodes

729
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,960
for all of these nodes here and so we

730
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,960
are done our third step now one thing

731
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,200
you should notice here though

732
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,080
is we don't need to go another step

733
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,679
further because we've already found our

734
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,960
destination we found Aurora in the set

735
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,360
and that is exactly where we want to go

736
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,960
and so all we need to do now is quite

737
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,639
simply back Trace from Aurora to

738
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,200
Richmond Hill to vaugh to Toronto and we

739
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,240
have found our destination so the way we

740
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,600
need to go is we take a look at Aurora

741
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,360
and we write down okay

742
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,279
Aurora where does Aurora come from well

743
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,799
Aurora came from Richmond Hill with a 19

744
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,679
km dist oh sorry 14 km distance so it

745
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,440
came from

746
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,760
richond Hill and the distance here was

747
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,880
14 km then you take a look at the

748
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,679
Richmond Hill from the other set and

749
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,960
Richmond Hill came from vaugh with a 7

750
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,720
km distance so it came from vaugh

751
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:04,440
with a six seven sorry kilm distance and

752
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,600
then Von came from Toronto as you can

753
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,960
see up there uh and as you can see the

754
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,040
distance is 24 km and we have found our

755
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,440
path to get from Toronto to Aurora and

756
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,079
Aurora to Toronto all we need to do now

757
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,320
is calculate the distance so

758
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,280
14724 and finally as you can see if I

759
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,720
quickly do the calculations here here we

760
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,359
end up with a

761
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:33,879
sorry

762
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:38,159
45 km

763
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,399
distance and there we go we have

764
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,800
completed our breath first search

765
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,879
testing here and as you can see what

766
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,119
we've done is we've taken this

767
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,599
hierarchical graph along with the

768
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,919
distance values it represents and we've

769
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:55,919
been able to go from and Traverse from

770
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,240
Toronto to Aurora

771
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,119
via V and Richmond Hill using the breett

772
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,760
first search algorithm all right so that

773
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,480
was it for this video today of course

774
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,720
I'd like to say a big thank you to

775
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,480
Nicholas for actually sending in this

776
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,280
question and giving me the suggestion

777
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,079
for this video today of course I will be

778
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,480
creating many more videos about how you

779
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,960
can use this with the Maze and how you

780
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,440
can use a star with this hierarchical

781
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,680
graph all right so that's going to be it

782
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,280
for this tutorial however in the next

783
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,839
part of this video you're going to

784
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,079
seeing an actual implementation of this

785
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,320
in Swift along with my own

786
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,160
implementation of how a hierarchical

787
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,640
graph itself can be implemented in Swift

788
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,680
all right so that's going to be it for

789
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,160
this video thank you very much for
