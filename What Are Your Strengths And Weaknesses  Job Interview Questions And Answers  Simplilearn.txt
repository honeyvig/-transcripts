about your strengths and weaknesses in

strengths and weaknesses in an honest
yet qualifying way here we are to prep
you up with the answer to this question

imagine when your interview is going all
well and suddenly the interviewer asks
you what your strengths and weaknesses
are why do you think such a question is
asked in the first place well it is
asked to see how good you evaluate
yourself and how self-aware you are
through your answer the interviewer also
tries to understand how fit you are for
the job based on its nature hence it is
of utmost importance that you prepare
your answer well and not let it damage
your chances of being hired all of us
have strengths and weaknesses however
what matters here is if you acknowledge
them and how cleverly you presented
before the interviewer
let's begin with the first part of the
question and that is what your strengths
are so do you think you need to praise
yourself while answering this
absolutely not
refrain from using multiple adjectives
to showcase how good you are as this can
make you look overconfident instead use
a couple of attributes that you think
you have and at the same time those that
are going to be highly beneficial for
the job that you are applying for
the best way you can do this is by
understanding the job description well
and mapping your qualities to those that
can be a boon to the job for example if
you apply for a job that requires you to
work with data and provide business
results one of your biggest strengths
could be problem solving and critical
thinking
other examples of strengths that work
well for almost every job are an eye for
detail team player time management
flexibility quick learner etc the next
key point to keep in mind is to pinpoint
your strengths with evidence just
listing these adjectives won't suffice
you need to speak of one or two
situations at work or during your
college times wherein you have been
successful because of your strength for
instance you can say how your time
management skill helped you complete a
project way before the deadline
this way you're supporting your strength
with a true story as well by doing this
you sound honest and more believable to
the interviewer you are free to add
other strings that you feel suit you
however keep the list short and quantify
it down on that note i have a small
question for you all
apart from the previously mentioned
strings do you have any other
interesting strengths that can impress
the recruiter if yes please pause and
tell us what the skill is you can drop
your answers in the comment section
below now let's get to the trickier part
and that is how to answer what are your
weaknesses before answering this
question carry out a self-reflection
identify your weakness and try to
improve our first tip to you here is not
to say that you don't have any
weaknesses because the interviewer will
understand in a jiffy that you are lying
all of us have some weaknesses and it's
okay to acknowledge them next don't try
to answer this question with an obvious
strength for example do not say you're
too hard working or that you are an
idealist this sounds unbelievable and
too cliche you shouldn't answer this
question with any of your personal
weaknesses and remember to be
professional so how do you answer them
think of a real weakness that you have
experienced in the past and construct a
story around it the next step is to
mention how you are working on your
weaknesses and mention the steps you
have taken to overcome them weaknesses
are not personality traits hence one can
always take the initiative to overcome
them what matters is for us to be
cognizant of our weaknesses
interviewers should feel like your
weaknesses are no longer that bad and
you must keep them in the past
when listing your weaknesses you need to
be clever and read the job description
first sometimes the weaknesses you say
might not gel well with the job you're
applying for it would be best if you
don't seem like a misfit for the job
because of your weakness hence it is
safe if you speak of a legitimate
weakness simultaneously a one that
doesn't affect your hiring a few
weaknesses you can say depending on the
job profile are public speaking
attention to detail as you tend to spend
more time learning to multitask being
straightforward etc
once again make sure to choose a
weakness that doesn't largely affect the
job you're applying for so those were
our tips to help you answer the
interview question what are your
strengths and weaknesses this question
can be tough if you don't prepare
beforehand hence make sure to follow the
strategy we have discussed here to nail
your answer that brings us to the end of
this video i hope these tips were
helpful and we wish you all the very
best thank you for watching this video
