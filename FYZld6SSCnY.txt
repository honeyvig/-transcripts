[Music]

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,679
hi t uh thank you so much for your

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,880
videos about services in Blu miix I'm

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,000
interested in a visual recognition

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,640
service in Blu miix and uh it would be

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,840
great if you could explain to me how I

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,080
can use this service I'm Bernie from

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,160
Germany thank you hello there and

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,200
welcome to another tutorial my name is

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,079
Hy Baki and this time we're going to be

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,120
going over how you can use the IBM wats

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,120
and visual recognition service in order

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,559
to classify images now to begin uh as

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,160
you can see Benny has sent me a question

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,960
she is one of my subscribers and is from

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,800
Germany uh and so she sent me a question

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,840
about the IBM Watson visual recognition

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,920
Service uh and so uh as you can tell uh

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,120
I'm going to be creating a video about

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,079
the topic now I've actually been getting

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,280
quite a few requests about this service

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,960
uh and to actually create a video about

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
it and so I decid

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,920
why not uh all right so now another

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,839
thing is uh its possibilities in the iot

26
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,240
field as well since it was actually

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,119
merged with Alchemy Vision since IBM

28
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,799
bought that a few years ago uh its

29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,119
possibilities in the iot field are

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,320
endless because of course it's much more

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,280
accurate now all right so let's begin so

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,600
now first of all as you can see I have

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,000
my uh Helper and model Bruno here uh who

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,759
is going to be sort of modeling for the

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,079
uh visual recognition classifier now if

36
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,159
you're wondering how a dog relates to

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,640
this uh video well essentially what's

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,799
going to happen is I'm going to train

39
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,640
the visual recognition classifier in

40
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,360
order to classify jog breeds and so it's

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,520
going to be able to differentiate

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,560
between a golden retriever uh a

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,640
Dalmatian and a husky uh now one more

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,119
thing this is extremely accurate so if

45
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:46,560
you were to put in uh another uh sort of

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,600
picture of an animal uh that's colored

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,840
very closely to a golden retriever uh it

48
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,360
would still be able to say you know what

49
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,520
this isn't a golden retriever uh because

50
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,640
what's going to happen is we're going to

51
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,680
feed in positive examples of a golden

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
retriever positive examples of a dalmi

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
and positive examples of a Husky but

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,320
also negative examples of animals that

55
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,119
are not uh dogs like for example cats

56
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,879
and lions uh and other animals like that

57
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,840
and humans uh and so it should be able

58
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,120
to differentiate between them all right

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,360
now we're going to be getting into the

60
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,599
Mac part where I'm going to be showing

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,160
you how to use crl commands in order to

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,040
actually train your own classifier using

63
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,319
the default data given by IBM Watson and

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,920
then we'll see if uh it can classify

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,000
Bruno here all right let's get to the

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,440
Mac part again thank you very much Bruno

67
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,560
all right let's get to it so welcome

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
back to the mag part and now I'm going

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,200
to be showing you how you can use the

70
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
visual recognition service in order to

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,680
classify dog breeds so let's begin now

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,239
first of all as you can see in blue miix

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,120
over here uh I have I'm about to create

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
a visual recognition Service uh and so

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm going to just choose the space

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,959
application just leave it Unbound if

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,080
you'd like uh the service name the

78
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,640
credential name and of course the

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,879
selected

80
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,040
plan uh which in this case is going to

81
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,200
be free for me if I click click on

82
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,560
create

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,239
now

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,040
then um in just a

85
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,200
second should create the

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,200
uh the uh classifier Ser I mean the

87
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,400
recognition

88
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,360
Service uh and as you can see here it is

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,319
done so now as you can see what we need

90
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,280
to do is go to the service

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,640
credentials uh and as you can see the

92
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,319
API key is over here now this is

93
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,080
actually a bit different than other and

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,879
services in that it doesn't give you a

95
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,439
username and a password instead it gives

96
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,200
it just one API key uh which is I I

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
usually like that it's more convenient

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,000
to have just one key rather than two

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,400
username and passwords so much better

100
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,280
all right so now continuing so now what

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,000
we're going to do uh is first of all I'm

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,519
going to show you how you can actually

103
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,400
create uh a corpus of knowledge that

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,079
we're going to give to Watson to train

105
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,959
it uh so let's begin first of all uh as

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,280
you can see what I have is text files of

107
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,480
URLs of lots of images of

108
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,879
dalmations golden

109
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,200
retrievers huskys and animals that are

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
not dogs like cats lions and

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
cheetahs so now remember these are

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
hundreds of URLs all right uh and so

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,000
basically uh what I'm doing is I've

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,440
created this python script and what this

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,120
uh really simple script does I I whip

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,160
this up in about five minutes not even

117
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,600
five and so basically uh what this does

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,000
is it will uh basically take uh a text

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,360
file

120
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,240
it will take the name of a text file in

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,400
its current directory it'll take a

122
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,360
directory name and what it'll do is

123
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,560
it'll read that text file uh for lots of

124
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,080
or sorry uh it'll read that text file

125
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
for lots of links uh to images uh and so

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,080
basically what can happen uh is I

127
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,039
essentially take these images I download

128
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,600
them uh and put them into a respective

129
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,280
directory that I told it to uh and then

130
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,240
later what I can do manually is just

131
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
compress these into zip files and then

132
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
send these to Watson to

133
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,680
train all right so now let's begin first

134
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,520
of all uh in order to actually uh sort

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,880
of download uh these text F first of all

136
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,759
though I won't be telling you how to get

137
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,759
the links into these text files though

138
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,759
that you're going to have to find out

139
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,440
yourself uh but uh this python file will

140
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,600
be available on GitHub for you to

141
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,520
download so that you can actually make

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,240
use of it uh so now what you need to do

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
in order to use this uh is it's a very

144
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
simple script all it is just python

145
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,639
download images give it the URL file for

146
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,199
example URLs Dalmations and tell it

147
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,400
where you want it to save uh in this

148
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,639
case dations Okay uh just enter and then

149
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,800
it'll download all the images but I have

150
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,919
them pre-downloaded

151
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,600
already all right so now that's how

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,319
you're going to download all of your

153
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,319
images uh once you have downloaded all

154
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,360
of your images as you can see uh

155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,880
hundreds of images here 280 to be exact

156
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,919
uh once those are all downloaded you can

157
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,240
of course uh send them to Watson now in

158
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,800
order to do that uh you need to compress

159
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,120
these into zip files uh and ensure that

160
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,960
these zip files are no larger than 50

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,080
megabytes if they are well back to the

162
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,240
drawing board for you uh you have to uh

163
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,000
somehow reduce the size of these zip

164
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,840
archives continuing though so now we're

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
going to be using a set of curl commands

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
uh because uh they haven't come out with

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,759
a toolkit for the visual recognition

168
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,240
Service uh to train with yet uh but we

169
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,319
will be using uh curl commands in order

170
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,199
to train our classifier all right so now

171
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,360
as you can see I have this little curl

172
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,800
command set up and basically what this

173
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,520
means is we're going to be sending a

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,720
post request uh to the Watson platform

175
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,080
Gateway uh and basically I'm going to

176
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,599
enter my API key uh as you could see

177
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,440
here though I'm just going to copy and

178
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,960
paste in my API key to this

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,800
URL and so uh quite generic actually uh

180
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,360
we're just creating a classifier with a

181
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,639
name TB dog classifier tany back she's

182
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,800
dog classifier is what it stands for

183
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,599
we're giving it some Dalmation positive

184
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,720
examples over here uh um in fact if I

185
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,560
can just yeah so as you can see we're

186
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,599
giving it some uh Dalmation positive

187
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,160
examples here uh and we're telling it

188
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,639
dalmati dzip uh to find them husky

189
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,560
positive examples husky. zip uh and

190
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,000
golden retriever positive examples

191
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,080
golden retriever do zip uh and of course

192
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,520
negative examples things that are not

193
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,720
dogs are not dogs

194
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,319
.zip and so as you can see over here so

195
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,039
now one more thing is in the actual curl

196
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,479
command I said Dalmation not Dalmations

197
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,160
and golden retriever not golden

198
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,039
retrievers and um

199
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,240
husky all right so now as you can see uh

200
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,520
I have this really simple curl command

201
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,879
ready that will start the training of

202
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,240
our classifier uh and I have these four

203
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,560
zip files ready as well so I'm going to

204
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,960
copy this curl command all right go to

205
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,319
terminal and as you can see if I list

206
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,280
directory here uh we have the zip files

207
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,440
here so now uh if I were to run this

208
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,759
curl command in

209
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,400
theory uh it says as you can see could

210
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
not open Dalmation doz let's see what

211
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,759
the problem is here

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
um oh yes I miss uh misspelled Dalmation

213
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,280
do zip sorry uh so it's not o n it's

214
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,560
just a n okay so now as you can see we

215
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,479
run this once more it'll be able to post

216
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,320
to

217
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,399
Watson

218
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,039
and in just a second now again it is

219
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,080
uploading uh quite a few images to

220
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,640
Watson so it may take a second and as

221
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,919
you can see it has submitted back to us

222
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,000
our classifier ID the classifier name

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,680
the owner which is me uh the status

224
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,440
which is currently uh it's currently in

225
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,200
training and the three classes that

226
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,240
it'll classify between all right now one

227
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
more thing this is actually a curl

228
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
command which you can use to check the

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,920
training status uh just like you can of

230
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,959
like uh let's say retrieving rank uh and

231
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,200
so if I go back to the result of this um

232
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,839
uh curl command over here as you can see

233
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm going to copy the classifier

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,880
ID copy

235
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,560
it uh wherever it says uh classifier ID

236
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,079
in this document I'm going to paste that

237
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:21,640
in uh and where it says API key I'm

238
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,920
going to paste in my API key all

239
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,680
right then all I need to do is copy this

240
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
curl command move it uh to my terminal

241
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,320
paste it in and as you can see it is

242
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,360
currently training now we've sent it

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
around I'd say 600 images which is a lot

244
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
of images and each of them uh are not

245
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,360
too huge I mean in total it was around 5

246
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
megabytes of data that we're sending or

247
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,200
6 megabytes of data uh so it shouldn't

248
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
be too long until it trains this might

249
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,959
take up to an hour or two uh then again

250
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,519
if you're sending many more images I

251
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,600
currently did like around 200 uh per

252
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,640
class uh and they were just under 2

253
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,959
megabytes

254
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,959
uh and so I mean you could fit thousands

255
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,959
of images uh in 50 megabytes so yeah so

256
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,640
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

257
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
pause the video uh and right as it is

258
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,120
done training whether it be in a few

259
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,959
hours or maybe even tomorrow I'm going

260
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,160
to continue uh recording uh and then

261
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,640
we're going to move uh sort of Stitch

262
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,040
these two videos together uh and then we

263
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,279
will uh see how our classifier turned

264
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,240
out uh and as you know my good old

265
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,880
friend Bruno uh that I was showing you

266
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
in the beginning of the video uh he is

267
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,240
going to be one of our test subjects uh

268
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,600
in our video today all right so uh I'm

269
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,720
going to be back in a few hours uh once

270
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,800
it is done

271
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,680
training so the classifier is finally

272
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,880
done training uh it's been around 15

273
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,200
minutes uh not as long as I expected

274
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,760
actually uh and actually took much less

275
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,440
than I expected uh and so yeah that's

276
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,480
great uh so it took 15 minutes I was

277
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,279
expecting 1 to two hours maybe even a

278
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,120
day uh to classify around 600 images but

279
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,000
it was able to do it within 15 minutes

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,120
I'm very excited about that so as you

281
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,680
can see this is actually a picture of

282
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
Bruno that we are going to be

283
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,279
classifying over here uh and so he is a

284
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,800
Golden Retriever as you should probably

285
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,880
know uh and so yeah we're going to see

286
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
if Watson can label him as a golden

287
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,639
retriever so first of all as you can see

288
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,160
uh I've actually set up a tiny URL link

289
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,519
uh that that is a direct link to Bruno's

290
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,920
picture this Bruno picture uh and so

291
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,200
basically uh Yes actually Watson's

292
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,360
visual recognition takes a URL as a

293
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,920
parameter uh for an image uh and so

294
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,680
basically it can follow those redirects

295
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,680
so it will find the final link uh and

296
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,120
then download that and send it um and so

297
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,680
yeah it's able to resolve those links

298
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,480
now as you can see in Adam over here I

299
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,240
mean Sublime

300
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,600
Text uh now basically I'm running the

301
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,959
classify um sort of endpoint here uh but

302
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,519
I'm giving it the API key if you know

303
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,639
the normal API key and I'm setting a URL

304
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,360
to the tiny URL that is a direct link to

305
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,839
Bruno's picture then I'm setting the

306
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,200
classifier IDS to just my uh class

307
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,160
classifier ID that I set up the owner is

308
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,600
me not IBM and the threshold is

309
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
zero and I'm setting the version of the

310
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,279
classifier to use to 20160520 which is

311
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,519
the current latest

312
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,839
version all right so now I just put

313
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,720
these enters in so it was a bit easier

314
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,360
to understand so if I remove all of

315
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,320
these real quick as you can see this is

316
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,120
a valid curl command which I should

317
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,079
technically be able to paste into my

318
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,920
terminal and as you can see what's going

319
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
to happen is if I actually copy this

320
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
tiny URL

321
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,040
link um and if I paste it

322
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,199
in it will download a

323
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:44,480
file um which is Bruno's

324
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,800
picture again sometimes the Internet

325
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,959
isn't always cooperating with you oh as

326
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,480
you can see it's done uh and is over

327
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,680
