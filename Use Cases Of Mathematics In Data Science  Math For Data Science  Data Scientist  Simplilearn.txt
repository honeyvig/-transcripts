started hi everyone and welcome to this
module and we will be discussing on use
cases of mathematics in data science
then we have beijan
inference so beijan inference is used
widely in different vertical it's a
popular data science technique used for
businesses especially for pricing
decisions so businesses they can
determine the prices for products based
on field information like retail and
wholesale prices the size of the market
and the market share so it can be used
for new product development as a whole
maybe one would look at the different
Risk by being uncertainties and
determining if the project is worth it
or not but again when it comes down to
the beijan inference and the business
decisions the most common application
relates to the product ranking so many
systems they have been developed to help
customers have an ideal and customized
shopping
experiences so online shopping giants
like Amazon uses it to make rating
appear natural when searching for a
product as opposed to displaying
rankings in the order the default option
it is used in terms of marketing so
again we use it to look at previous
campaigns and marketing information to
improvise the existing campaigns or make
new
ones hypothesis
testing then we have hypothesis testing
so hypothesis testing is used in
different scenarios first of all it is
used in clinical trials as well so many
Pharmacists and doctors they use
hypothesis testing for clinical trials
so the impact of a new clinical method
medicine or procedure or the condition
of the patient is analyzed through
hypothesis testing for example a
pharmacist believes that the new
medicine is resulting in the rise of
blood pressure in diabetic
patients now to test this assumption the
researcher has to to measure the blood
pressure of the sample patients before
and after the intake of new medicine for
nearly a particular period let's say 1
month so then there can be two scenarios
we have the null hypothesis like the
average blood pressure is the same after
and before the conception of medicine
and then we can have alternative
hypothesis where the average blood
pressure after the consumption of the
medicine is less than the average blood
pressure before the consumption of
medicine so the P value of hypothesis
test is less than the significance value
than null hypothesis is going to be
rejected it is also used widely in
testing the effectiveness of the
fertilizers on Plants so nowadays it is
highly used by Farmers by those in the
agricultural vertical so suppose let's
say a researcher wants to check their
assumption that a particular fertilizer
may result in Faster growth of the plant
in a month and its usual growth than
what is observed I suppose in a couple
of plants now to verify this assumption
we will consistently give the fertilizer
to the plant for nearly a month and then
it can be further divided into two
hypotheses null and alternative where
null will be like fertilizer does not
have any influence on the growth and
alternative can be the fertilizer
results in a faster growth of the plant
and it is also used highly in
manufacturing sectors as well so it is
used in finding the defects in any kind
of manufactured product for example
let's say manufacturing plan X decides
to verify that the particular method
results in an increase in the defective
products per quarter let's say the
number can be 200 now to verify this we
can calculate the mean of numbers of
defective products produced before the
start and end of the quarter so again we
can divide them into two different
scenarios null and alternative when null
can be the average number of defective
products and alternative can be the
average number of defective products
before and after the implementation of
the new method and then we can see which
one fits into our current criteria then
we have image and Signal
processing so we have a number of use
cases for image processing and it is
highly used in different verticals
including Insurance retail banking in
pharmaceutical especially in the
Healthcare Community as well so
basically is used in reverse image
search for different
purposes so for example if we have any
image that we want to search the web
page if we use this image for performing
a search
we can drag and drop search and then any
search engine will be able to use this
image as a base and give us all the
relevant links where we can find image
or whatever is present in the image so
this is called as a reverse image search
so we can search by an image and find
out the relevant details about it so it
uses the artificial intelligence
software and image recognition
techniques to identify image content and
then compare them with billions of
images indexed on the web so the image
recognition algorithms they help out
find out similar images the origin of
the image and information about the
owner of the image websites using the
same image image plagiarism and all
other relevant information in the past
reverse image was only used for finding
the similar images on the web but today
we can use it for multiple other
requirements as well then we talk about
linear
regression so linear regression is
basically a technique through which we
can model the relationship between
different data pointers and one of the
most widely used use case is the weight
loss reduction so the problem of
predicting the weight reduction in the
form of number of kilos red reduced
hypothetically could depend upon the
input features that we have age height
the weight of the person and the time
spent on exercises so weight reduction
is going to be the function of age
height weight and time spent on
exercises so that's why we have a shoe
size which is going to be based on the
height weight age to time on exercise so
as a part of creating the above model
the goal will be to find the value of B1
B2 B3 B4 and B 0 which would minimize
the objective function so the objective
function would be the summation of mean
squared error which is nothing but the
sum of the square of actual value and
the predicted value for different values
of age height weight and time spent on
exercises that's how it's going to be it
is also used for forecasting the
performance of students based on the
marks based on the number of hours they
have put in
let's consider the problem of predicting
the marks of a student based on number
of hours he or she puts into the
preparation although at the outside it
may look like a problem that can be
modeled using simple linear regression
it could turn out to be a multiple
linear regression problem depending upon
multiple input features and
alternatively it can also look like a
problem that can be modeled using simple
linear regression but it can be a
multiple linear regression problem so
let's assume for the sake of
understanding that the marks of student
M depends upon the number of hours he or
she puts for the preparation so this is
going to be the formula that can
represent this model marks where M
multiplied by the hours plus the
constant so the best way to determine
whether it is simple linear regression
problem will be to do a plot of marks
versus hours it a plot is going to be
completely diagonal and again it is
going to be a good fit for linear
regression setup so we have predicted
modeling which is basically used to
model the probability distribution of
variables in a given data set so there
are multiple use cases first of all we
have churn
prevention so when a business loses a
customer it has to replace a loss of
Revenue by bringing a new customer so it
proves to be expensive as the cost of
acquiring a new customer is much higher
than retaining the existing customer so
Predictive Analytics model they help us
in preventing the churn in our customer
base by analyzing the dissatisfaction
among our current customers and then
identifying the customer segments at
most risk for leaving our businesses can
make the necessary modifications using
predictive data to keep customers happy
and satisfied eventually protecting
their revenue and then it is also used
for customer segmentation so it allows
us to group the customers by shared
traits in different businesses they
Define the market differently depending
upon the aspects that offer the most
value to the Company products or
services so profound use of this
analysis technique allows us to Target
the markets based on accurate insight
and indicators and then we can analyze
these segments of those most interested
in what our company offers so there are
multiple verticals like banking
pharmaceutical retail Insurance
Automotive sector they all make use of
customer segmentation and then in terms
of quality assurance so ineffective
quality control will affect our customer
satisfaction scale and ultimately impact
the revenue and market share also leads
to more customer support calls warranty
issues repairs for inefficient
manufacturing and so on so using
Predictive Analytics we can help
identify high-risk modules in our
application where we can prioritize the
critical areas we can reduce the time to
Market through shift left testing and by
using this we are going to get a better
quality and we will be able to tame
customers for long and different
verticals like pharmaceutical
manufacturing Automotive logistic
Transportation they all make use of this
to keep on improvising their current
business models and as we discussed
earlier there are multiple use cases of
these in
healthcare like we use that in creating
some kind of prediction modeling so all
the data sets from the demographics
clinical measurements medical history
mathematics they all are used to create
models so that we can make an accurate
prediction how the same data set is
going to behave for any future
references how we can find the most
probable condition before it actually
happens so they Ed to analyze large data
sets of health related information so
that we can prevent the disease before
they happen like we have the image
scanning for lung So based on the
previous lung cancer patients we know
what exactly is a pattern or development
of cancer cells and based on the current
scanning which has already been
completed we can let the patient know if
they are having a probability of
developing the same lung cancer or not
so that since they will be having enough
amount of
time we can make the right decision at
the right time so that the prevention of
cancer can get started before it
spreads then we have some clinical files
like we discussed so mathematics play a
crucial role in the design and Analysis
of clinical trials so we can make use of
the models we can make use of the
hypothesis testing to see if a given d
drug is effective or not and then we can
carry on with other hypothesis scenarios
it is used for medical imaging so that
we can know how exactly we can identify
tumors we can identify cells we can
identify some kind of cancer cells
before they actually start in the blood
so that we can analyze thousands of
previous scans done and based on the
pattern seen in the actual patients we
can cross verify that by using the
current scan and simply get the best
probability of developing a Cancer and
so on these all things can be easily
verified there and it is also used in
Precision medicine to ensure that we are
able to give and use the right amount of
medicine so that the possibility of them
getting an overdose or getting less than
what will be effective for their
treatment can be avoided so these things
are all done by using machine
