1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,280
tutorial my name is tandy bakshi and

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,560
today we're going to be talking about

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,400
how you can use cuda to build your own

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,960
segmented silva vera tostony's based nth

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,519
prime finder that runs on the gpu now i

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,040
know that's a lot of words i'll explain

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,719
exactly what that means but before we

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,400

19
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
the social media in the description box

20
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,360
as well

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
now getting into this what are we doing

22
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
today we are building an nth prime

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,600
calculator and we're going to do so

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
using the segmented silva veritosthenes

25
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,200
algorithm and we're going to be running

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
it on the gpu using the cuda gpu compute

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,719
library now this is a pretty fascinating

28
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,280
application i will say i've been really

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
interested in optimizing compute or

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,440
optimizing algorithms rather

31
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
to make use of compute for finding prime

32
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,960
numbers i find that a very fascinating

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
field and recently i actually

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,080
implemented uh a cuda based version of

35
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
this algorithm as well

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
before we get into

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
using gpus for this why you would want

38
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,799
to do that and what the segmented

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,640
cellular eratosthenes is let's talk

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
about just the simple plain old classic

41
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
ancient literally siva veritostomy's

42
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
algorithm the sea of veritas algorithm

43
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,360
doesn't exactly solve the problem that

44
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,840
we want to solve it doesn't give you the

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,960
nth prime number instead what it does uh

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,520
is it gives you well in in a list of

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,759
numbers starting from the number two

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,759
which ones are prime and which ones are

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
composite that's what it'll tell you so

50
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,200
for example if you list out the numbers

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,840
two to fifty you can use this the sieve

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,520
of eratosthenes to go through those

53
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
numbers and mark the ones that are

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
composite as composite and only keep the

55
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
primes

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,880
let's actually take a look at a little

57
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,720
bit of a demonstration as to how that

58
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,040
works so effectively we start off with

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
of course our numbers 2 through 50 here

60
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,280
and we start off by looking at the

61
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
number 2. number 2 has not been marked

62
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,600
it's just a number and so we take a look

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
at it and we say it's prime but because

64
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
it hasn't been marked and because we

65
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,000
just considered it prime we're now going

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,319
to loop through all the multiples of two

67
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,599
from here on out and we're gonna mark

68
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,520
them all as composite which makes sense

69
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
because they are all divisible by two so

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
it makes sense that we want to mark them

71
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
down as composite then we take a look at

72
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,080
the number three has not been marked yet

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,400
so we consider it prime we loop through

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,160
all the multiples of three and we we

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,239
mark them as composite

76
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,680
then we take a look at four four has

77
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
been marked we ignore it we take a look

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,360
at five five has not been marked

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
therefore it is prime and we loop

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
through all of its multiples and mark

81
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
them as composite as well then we ignore

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
six because it's marked then once again

83
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,360
for seven we take a look at it and we

84
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
mark its one remaining multiple in this

85
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,000
list well there are other multiples but

86
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,920
the one multiple has not yet been marked

87
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,280
we mark it as composite

88
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
we then go ahead and loop through all

89
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
the rest of these numbers and for each

90
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,120
one we ensure that all of their

91
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,680
multiples are marked as composite and

92
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,400
after we're done all of that we have our

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
list of prime numbers effectively right

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,560
so we can boil it all down um to these

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
these numbers that we know between 2 and

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
50 are indeed prime

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
however here's something really

98
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,680
interesting about the way that this math

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
works and this is sort of our little

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
cheat code that's going to let us speed

101
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,159
up the compute a bunch right

102
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,959
that is that if you take a look at these

103
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,319
numbers again right after we were done

104
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
marking seven

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,720
we really didn't need to mark anything

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,159
else because if you take a look at for

107
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,920
example the number 11.

108
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,680
if you look at all the numbers that it

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,519
would have marked if you look at all the

110
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,120
multiples of 11 they've already been

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
marked by other numbers before 11. right

112
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,799
similarly if you take a look at 13 the

113
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,799
numbers that it would have marked as

114
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,680
composite have already been marked as

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,560
composite we don't really need to do

116
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,640
anything beyond the number seven why is

117
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
that though well it's because of a very

118
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
interesting property here you see the

119
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,360
maximum number that we have in this list

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,000
of numbers is 50. the square root of 50

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,319
is about seven it's just above seven

122
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,200
right

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
what that means is that if we know all

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
the prime numbers up until seven we can

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
just use those and mark all the

126
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,120
multiples of those primes as composite

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
and that's all we need to do right we

128
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
don't actually need to loop through for

129
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
example 11's multiples and 13s multiples

130
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
and 17's multiples we don't need to do

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
that as long as we go up to 7 and mark

132
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,880
all of 2 3 5 and 7's multiples as

133
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,199
composite we're good to go we don't need

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,759
to lose through any others now

135
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,320
this gives us a couple of very sort of

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
interesting alternatives as to how we

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
can compute

138
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,560
first of all

139
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,320
why do we need to make this better i

140
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,919
mean of course it's nice that we only

141
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,280
have a couple of numbers that we need to

142
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
start marking from

143
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
but what about the siva veritosthenes

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
makes it slow why do we need some you

145
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,360
know extra tricks well it's because of

146
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,759
this the sieve of eratosthenes is

147
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,360
absolutely

148
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
terrible from a memory perspective now

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
from a computational complexity

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
standpoint it's actually pretty simple

151
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,240
but from a memory complexity standpoint

152
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
in terms of like actually accessing

153
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
memory on the hardware

154
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,320
it is terrible what do i mean by that

155
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,360
well

156
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
if we take a look at this list of

157
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,479
numbers again starting off with for

158
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,919
example two

159
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,720
when we had to mark all of the multiples

160
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
of two as composite what we had to do is

161
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
loop all the way from the beginning of

162
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,759
this array to the end of the array

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,160
and then for the number three we had to

164
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
start all the way back at the beginning

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,240
and loop all the way to the end

166
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
now that doesn't sound like much of a

167
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,360
problem there's just 50 numbers and

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
that's totally fine with 50 numbers that

169
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
doesn't make much of a difference but

170
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
the problem is when you get into the

171
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,479
hundreds of billions of numbers or

172
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,720
something on that scale because now

173
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,400
what's happening is this

174
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
as you're looping through your array of

175
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
boolean values to see if this number is

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,440
marked or not you are moving across

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,240
sections of the array and every time you

178
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
move across a certain sized section of

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
the array that entire section needs to

180
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,759
be loaded into cpu cache the old section

181
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,400
is invalidated thrown out of cpu cache

182
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
and now you're dealing with that section

183
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
you do this over and over again until

184
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
you get to the next uh prime that you

185
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
need to mark multiples for and then you

186
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
start at the beginning right you

187
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
invalidate what's in cpu cache you go

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,319
grab the beginning of the array put that

189
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,160
in cpu cache you start working on it and

190
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,919
you keep invalidating cash over and over

191
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,000
again that is

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,720
slow as much as possible you want to

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
avoid invalidating cash when you can't

194
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,960
you want to maintain the locality of

195
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,639
reference principle you want to make it

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,080
so that whenever you have subsequent

197
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
memory accesses as much as possible

198
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,000
they're as close to each other as

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,840
possible to increase the likelihood that

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,240
you are going to be getting cash hits

201
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,199
instead of missing your

202
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,680
the cash

203
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
of eratosthenes does not care about that

204
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
though and that's a problem

205
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
and that's why the segmented scene of

206
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,160
eratosthenes exists it helps us in a

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,759
very special way

208
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
what it enables us to do is i mean think

209
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
about it

210
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
if we know that from two to fifty the

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
only primes that we need to know

212
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,520
beforehand are two three five and seven

213
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
then we can go ahead and pre-calculate

214
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,440
that with a normal sea of vertositis

215
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
right we can find all the primes up to

216
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,199
the square root of 50 in this case

217
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
around 7. so we have 2 3 5 and 7.

218
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
then what we can do is we can take

219
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,639
chunks of the rest of the array and in

220
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,000
each chunk individually mark multiples

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
of those primes as composite so now for

222
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,680
example what we could actually do is

223
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
take the row of you know from 11 to 20

224
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
and 21 through 30 and 31 through 40 and

225
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
41 through 50 those four different

226
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,360
individual sections could be computed in

227
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
a completely isolated environment right

228
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,000
given any one of those chunks you can

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,919
determine which numbers are prime and

230
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,639
which numbers are composite uh based off

231
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,479
of just the numbers 2 3 5 and 7. so

232
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,960
in case you may have also missed this

233
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,800
not only does this help with locality of

234
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
reference because now each chunk that

235
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,879
you have to operate on is smaller

236
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,280
the chunks are isolated

237
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,039
and you know what that means if they're

238
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
isolated they can all be done at the

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,039
same time so that means you can

240
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,800
multi-thread your code and thereby make

241
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
it even faster

242
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
and there's a lot of really interesting

243
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,120
other tricks that you can apply here as

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,279
well like for example instead of having

245
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,519
an actual array of booleans where each

246
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,320
boolean takes an entire byte eight bits

247
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,080
worth of information even though it's

248
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
only a boolean so it needs a single bit

249
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
you can use bit arrays where you

250
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,480
effectively have eight booleans in a

251
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,880
single byte it's really fascinating all

252
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
the optimizations you can apply

253
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,200
and then of course because this compute

254
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
is incredibly repetitive and almost the

255
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,240
same for every individual chunk of

256
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
course there's some exceptions with you

257
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,440
know certain loops maybe being a little

258
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
bit longer or shorter for individual

259
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
branches

260
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,040
because they're effectively the same you

261
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,600
can implement this as cuda code and you

262
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,279
can make it so that given a bunch of

263
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,040
seed primes like two three five and

264
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
seven up until 50

265
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
you can calculate which numbers are

266
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,440
priming composite in individual chunks

267
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
on the gpu now this is pretty

268
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,959
fascinating stuff let's go ahead and

269
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,640
take a look at how you can actually

270
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,760
implement it uh using cuda let's take a

271
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,120
look

272
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
all right now that you understand the

273
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,760
idea of the segmented sea of

274
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,200
eratosthenes let's go ahead and take a

275
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,040
look at the code and see why the

276
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
application works

277
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
so as you can see here i've got the code

278
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
pulled up and you're going to need to

279
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,959
bear with me here because it is pretty

280
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,640
dense there's a lot of stuff happening

281
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
there's a lot of logic here that might

282
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
take a while for you to understand of

283
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,080
course as always the code is linked in

284
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
the description below for you to go

285
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
ahead and check out for yourself if

286
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,399
you'd like to sort of read through it

287
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,600
more slowly

288
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
and sort of reference with the video to

289
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,440
understand individual sections of logic

290
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
and why it works

291
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,680
this is of course cuda c plus plus code

292
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
um which means that we have our

293
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,440
traditional c plus includes in the

294
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
beginning i will be going through these

295
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
we'll see where we use the functions

296
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,440
later on in the code um

297
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,000
but we start off pretty simply with our

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
definitions this code is multi-gpu

299
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
compatible so because i have two gpus on

300
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
this machine

301
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
as you can see here or it doesn't want

302
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
to work inside the docker container

303
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,519
maybe we'll do it right outside uh let's

304
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,000
do it here there we go you can see that

305
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
i have the two uh these are 230 90 ti's

306
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,640
that are running um enabling us to

307
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
calculate primes

308
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,279
so i am defining two gpus

309
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,040
i'm defining a byte type as just

310
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,399
unsigned character just because it's

311
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,839
easier to write byte than unsigned

312
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,279
character everywhere

313
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,279
i'm defining that when we invoke the

314
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,680
cuda kernel we will invoke it with 64

315
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
threads and 256 blocks these are numbers

316
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,320
that you can play around with to find

317
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
the most effective values for your use

318
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
case and i will link to some resources

319
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,079
to sort of explain what these mean in

320
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,760
more detail down in the description

321
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,880
below

322
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,480
now we start off with some pretty simple

323
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,800
high-level logic functions to create a

324
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,200
bit array to get an element from it from

325
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,279
a bit array and to set an element from a

326
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,920
bit array this uses pretty simple logic

327
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
for example if you have a number of

328
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,720
elements you want to store in the bit

329
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,440
array that number divided by eight plus

330
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,920
potentially one more byte if it's not

331
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,000
divisible by eight is how many bytes

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
you're going to need to represent these

333
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,399
number of elements as boolean values in

334
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,079
a bit array

335
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,800
a bit array get simply takes the index

336
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,600
computes which byte and which bit you

337
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,760
need to access in order to return that

338
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,680
value and bit array set does something

339
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,760
similar except it actually sets the

340
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,920
value using the masks that it calculates

341
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
now we have the naive c function the

342
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
naive c function is basically just a

343
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,600
completely normal sea of eratosthenes

344
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,040
there's nothing particularly special

345
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
about it

346
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,920
the way that it works

347
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
is you give an upper bound that you want

348
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,639
to see until and you also pass it a

349
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,639
pointer to both a

350
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
an array where you will where you want

351
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,639
it to store the primes

352
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
as well as a number to store how many

353
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,360
primes it actually found

354
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
so the sieve does not return the boolean

355
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
array instead it actually returns to you

356
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,440
which primes it found up until the upper

357
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,480
bound

358
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,040
we start off by creating a bit array

359
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
so we can store the true false values of

360
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,560
which numbers are prime and which ones

361
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,720
are composite we start off by saying

362
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
that the total number of primes we found

363
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,440
so far is equal to the upper bound minus

364
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,800
two

365
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
because of course zero and one don't

366
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,480
count and then we start looping so we

367
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
start off with number two and we loop up

368
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
until effectively the square root of the

369
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
upper bound this is just a more sort of

370
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
concise way of saying that

371
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,639
while p times p so p squared is less

372
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,000
than the upper bound is just another way

373
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,839
of saying um

374
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,839
the square root of the upper bound

375
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,800
uh and we always increment so if when we

376
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,440
loop we see in the bit array that the

377
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,760
value is prime not composite meaning

378
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
that the value is still 0 in the bit

379
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
array

380
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,680
then for all of the multiples of this

381
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,480
number we mark them as composite if they

382
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,720
are not already marked so we go ahead

383
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
and check for the multiple is it marked

384
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,240
as prime if it is uh then we decrease

385
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,760
from the total number of primes and we

386
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
set it so that it's marked as composite

387
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,360
so that in the future we don't end up

388
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
marking it as composite again the reason

389
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,519
that this is important to do is because

390
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
then we are able to keep track of how

391
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,399
many primes we actually found

392
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,320
once this is done we go ahead and set

393
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
the prime count value that was passed

394
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,720
into the function as a pointer we then

395
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,839
go ahead and set the array to a a memory

396
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,519
allocation

397
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,639
for the total number of primes times the

398
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,600
size of an unsigned 64-bit integer

399
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,760
we then loop through our bit array

400
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,880
effectively

401
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,040
and for every number that is still

402
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,680
marked as prime we go ahead and add it

403
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
to the array and then we free the bit

404
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,279
array that we allocated up here once

405
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,399
again this is

406
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,560
c code c plus technically so we do need

407
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,839
to keep track of our memory manually

408
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680
all right so now that's done this is the

409
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,199
naive c function out of the way of

410
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,639
course we need this to figure out sort

411
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,360
of our seed primes so if we are sieving

412
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,680
all the way up to uh you know a billion

413
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,760
that we don't actually once again need

414
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
to sieve manually um all the way up to a

415
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
billion we see up until the square root

416
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
of a billion and then we use those c

417
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,959
primes in order to determine um the uh

418
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,079
which which numbers are prime and

419
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,160
neutrons are composite in individual

420
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,800
chunks leading up to a billion

421
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
so let's continue from there

422
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,480
next we have a function that's meant to

423
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
create bit arrays multiple bit arrays

424
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,839
and particularly for the gpu so the way

425
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
that this works is it takes as input the

426
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,560
number of elements per bit array that

427
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,839
need to be

428
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,120
created

429
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,360
and then it also takes as input a

430
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
pointer to a size t type called bytes

431
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,560
per bit array as well as a size t bit

432
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,600
arrays

433
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,839
let me explain what this means

434
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,040
so

435
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,839
when we have our gpu kernel of course

436
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,079
the idea of it is that it's going to see

437
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,240
multiple chunks at the same time that is

438
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,720
why the code is so fast because unlike

439
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,880
on an individual cpu core where you can

440
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
only see one chunk the gpu can see

441
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,199
many chunks at once

442
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,440
now whenever you're sieving a chunk just

443
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,959
like sort of we did here with the naive

444
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,199
c you need a bit array this bitter right

445
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,639
helps you keep track of which numbers

446
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,480
within the trunk are prime and which

447
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,000
ones are composite

448
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
now here's the thing because the gpu

449
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,839
kernel is doing thousands at a time

450
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
we don't necessarily want to have to

451
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,240
allocate a thousand different bit arrays

452
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,320
and pass each bit array pointer into the

453
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
kernel for it to use

454
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,399
instead what i want to do is allocate

455
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,959
one contiguous chunk of memory that has

456
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,120
enough space for all the thousands of

457
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,800
bit arrays that we need

458
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
and then just use that

459
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,839
that's because it's just more efficient

460
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,560
to do one contiguous allocation than to

461
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
have a thousand separate individual

462
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
isolated allocations

463
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
so the way this function works is it

464
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
takes a number of elements per bit array

465
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,680
and the number of bit arrays that you

466
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,079
want to allocate it'll tell you how many

467
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
bytes each bit array will take but then

468
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,399
it's actually going to allocate

469
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,720
that number times the number of bit

470
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,320
arrays that you want

471
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,639
so the gpu kernel can now take this one

472
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,519
contiguous block of memory and index an

473
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,240
individual section of it which is that

474
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
threads um sort of chunk that it needs

475
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,519
to use of the bit array

476
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,920
so that's that's what this function does

477
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
next up is the meat of the code this is

478
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,399
this is the fun part right this is the

479
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,839
gpu kernel

480
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,839
this is what helps us actually achieve

481
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,600
this you know wonderful performance of

482
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
calculating um the the billionth prime

483
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
and and so on

484
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,079
though this actually takes quite a few

485
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,839
inputs so let's take a moment to just go

486
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,440
through them

487
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,040
of course this function is also marked

488
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,199
as global this means that it is a cuda

489
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,480
kernel function this is something that

490
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,959
will run on the gpu all right so back to

491
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,079
the input

492
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
we start off by taking in is prime

493
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,720
arrays and is prime bytes

494
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,319
this is a

495
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,600
the contiguous bit arrays uh that we've

496
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,679
allocated using this previous function

497
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,079
um and these these bit arrays are going

498
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,760
to be used by each chunk to keep track

499
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
of the primes and the composites and is

500
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,679
prime bytes is how many bytes are used

501
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,559
by each bit array right so not the total

502
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,360
number of bytes in this contiguous block

503
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,559
rather how many bytes per individual sub

504
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,200
bit array within this contiguous block

505
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,559
now default prime count is basically

506
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,320
in each chunk because all the chunks are

507
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,679
the same sizes uh how many primes do we

508
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,840
expect by default right so uh for

509
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,919
example if you've got say you know

510
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,880
arbitrary number a chunk size of 10 um

511
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
then we know for example that all of the

512
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
even numbers within this chunk cannot be

513
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,440
prime so by default our default uh prime

514
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,760
count is actually five it's ten divided

515
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
by two uh because we know all the evens

516
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,360
cannot be prime uh five is our maximum

517
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
number of primes uh within the chunk

518
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,640
and what we do then in in the actual

519
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
function is we filter it down because we

520
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
know that not all the odd numbers are

521
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
necessarily prime we go ahead and filter

522
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
it down um to just the ones that

523
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
actually are prime

524
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
but this is just by default sort of our

525
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
maximum our upper bound of how many

526
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,600
primes there can be in each chunk

527
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
there are other ways to optimize this

528
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
and you can sort of like figure out per

529
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
chunk a better value um in order to

530
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,280
reduce the memory usage but we sort of

531
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,679
skip that um and this is just upper

532
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,400
bound uh based off of simply uh the

533
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,039
chunk size divided by two

534
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,160
um then of course we also have the array

535
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,120
where we want the gpu kernel to store

536
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
how many primes it found per chunk so if

537
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
the if the gpu is processing say you

538
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
know again arbitrary number a thousand

539
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
chunks then this array will have a

540
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
thousand elements

541
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
and each element will be per chunk how

542
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,320
many primes were found within the chunk

543
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
so just for context the gpu kernel does

544
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
not actually return the prime numbers

545
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
that it found rather it will only return

546
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,880
per chunk how many primes it found this

547
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,600
is useful because then on the cpu end of

548
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,919
things we can go through each chunk keep

549
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
keep keep track of how many primes were

550
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,559
counted and right as we see the nth

551
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,000
prime number that we're looking for say

552
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
we're looking for the millions prime

553
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
right as we see hey this chunk brought

554
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,280
us to a millionth prime

555
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,200
then we can go ahead and recalculate

556
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,280
that chunk on the cpu and figure out

557
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,600
which number was the millionth prime

558
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
this is a lot more efficient than

559
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
actually sending all of the prime

560
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
numbers from the gpu to the cpu because

561
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,840
of the way that the gpu works and i'll

562
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,080
explain that in just a moment

563
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
next of course is our seed primes and

564
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,679
seed prime count

565
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,840
c primes is just of course the uh the

566
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,640
primes from two to the square root of

567
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
the upper bound that we're that we're

568
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,840
seeing until

569
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,440
and this is just how many of those that

570
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
we found and then finally we have our

571
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,480
chunk size which is of course how many

572
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
like elements we we're dealing with per

573
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,840
chunk um and then chunk count which is

574
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
how many chunks we are dealing with in

575
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,559
total and also our chunk offset

576
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,240
what is the chunk offset you may ask

577
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,640
well basically once again this is

578
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,960
multi-gpu code right we are supporting

579
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,000
using uh in this case two gpus

580
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,400
now the problem with supporting multiple

581
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,159
gpus like this

582
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,919
is that

583
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
both of them need to somehow distribute

584
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,799
work and make sure that they're not

585
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,440
doing the same thing over and over again

586
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,600
the way we do this is by evenly

587
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
distributing the workload

588
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
let's just say once again we have 10

589
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,159
chunks that we need to process

590
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,200
what we do is we say gpu one will

591
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
process five chunks gpu two will process

592
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
another five chunks

593
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,440
however if gpus one and gpu two both

594
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,679
start at chunk zero and chunk five

595
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,559
chunks

596
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,960
both of them will end up processing

597
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,840
chunks 0 1 2 3 and 4.

598
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
that's a problem because now every chunk

599
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
has been duplicated and the next set of

600
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,919
chunks just hasn't been worked on

601
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
so what we do is for gpu 1 we set chunk

602
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,240
offset to 0. that means the gpu 1 will

603
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,679
process trunks 0 1 2 3 and 4.

604
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,960
however for gpu 2 we set chunk offset to

605
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,080
5. so when it wants to process chunk 0

606
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
it's actually going to add chunk offset

607
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,720
and end up processing chunk 5.

608
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,039
this makes it so that it's effectively

609
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,480
skipping all of the work that we know

610
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,200
the first gpu will get done anyway so

611
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,840
that's our offset for the gpu

612
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,919
kernel then within the kernel uh that

613
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,600
was just the input but now we get to the

614
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,799
fun part uh within the kernel uh we have

615
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,880
to do a little bit of ceremony in the

616
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
beginning to to get ready right so we

617
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,000
calculate our index so of course the way

618
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,320
cuda will invoke a kernel

619
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,960
is through blocks and threads using the

620
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,280
block dimensions and indexes

621
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,480
indices

622
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,880
and the threat indices we calculate the

623
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,520
index of this specific invocation and if

624
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
it somehow is beyond the chunk count for

625
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
example we inv we invoked with

626
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,000
more threads and blocks than we actually

627
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,159
had work to do then this specific

628
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,039
invocation of the kernel will return um

629
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,960
if if not though if this is a valid

630
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,440
invocation then we will go ahead and add

631
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,120
that index to the chunk offset and we

632
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,919
will use this um as

633
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,000
effectively like which index in the

634
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,799
global array of work

635
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,960
we are we are currently on

636
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,600
then we go ahead and get our bit array

637
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,320
and we do this by indexing our global

638
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,280
set of bit arrays and we add the index

639
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,760
that we're on times however many bytes

640
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,440
each bit array takes right so this will

641
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,480
figure out our memory offset inside this

642
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,000
global um contiguous block of bit arrays

643
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,520
and then this will give us sort of just

644
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,600
our pointer to our bit array that we can

645
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,360
safely use and make sure we're not

646
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,799
stepping on the toes of any other

647
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,520
indications of this kernel

648
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
um beyond that is some pretty

649
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,720
fascinating sieving logic that is

650
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
as far as i could get it to be

651
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,799
branchless because remember as much as

652
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,720
you want as much as possible at least

653
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,960
you want to make it that gpu code is

654
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,720
branchless you want to make it so

655
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,320
there's no if statements no branching

656
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,679
because

657
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,600
gpus are a lot simpler than cpus which

658
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,440
is why you can run thousands of these

659
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,840
threads at once so if any one thread

660
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,960
branches

661
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
all of your threads actually need to go

662
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,280
through the different branches that were

663
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,200
that were selected so it makes your code

664
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,039
slower basically

665
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,679
for example over here what i'm doing

666
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,720
is i'm calculating a low and a high

667
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,600
sort of

668
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,080
lower and an upper bound for the numbers

669
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
that we're actually dealing with in this

670
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,720
chunk

671
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,000
and

672
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,159
from there i want to skip any even

673
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,799
numbers so for example if low is an even

674
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,000
number

675
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,640
then i want to increment it uh to make

676
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,559
it odd and if high is an even number i

677
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,240
want to decrement it to make it odd

678
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,440
because again we don't want to waste our

679
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,960
time dealing with even numbers but

680
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
instead of doing an if statement where i

681
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,720
do a modulo and make sure that it's not

682
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,039
uh make sure that it's not

683
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,080
even instead i do a branchless mechanism

684
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,840
of doing the same thing which is

685
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
basically a bit wise and against the

686
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,360
number one to figure out if it is odd um

687
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
and if it's we just invert that and then

688
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
add that to low so it has effectively

689
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
the same

690
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
consequence consequence

691
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
of doing an if statement and an addition

692
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,440
uh however we don't actually need the if

693
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,960
statement

694
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
i then go ahead and reset the memory

695
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,559
within the actual bit array so that we

696
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,720
can we have a fresh slate

697
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,039
uh clean slate uh the reason this is

698
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,320
important is because there may have been

699
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
a previous invocation of the kernel uh

700
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,159
that has already used the bit array so

701
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,080
we just reset it completely

702
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
and when we actually do the allocation

703
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
of course over here there's no guarantee

704
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
of what was in the memory previously

705
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,360
and so this is just a sanity check just

706
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
making sure that everything is nice and

707
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
clean

708
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,159
after that we have the real seating

709
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,720
logic so we start off by once again sort

710
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
of like the naive sieve having a count

711
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
of how many primes we have so far which

712
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
in this particular case is just our

713
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
upper bound that we already specified

714
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,400
um and then we loop through all the seed

715
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,240
primes we do not start at zero we start

716
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
at one because the first seed prime

717
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,000
which would be at index zero

718
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,960
is the number two and once again all the

719
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
multiples of two

720
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,200
i.e the uh the even numbers we are

721
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
already skipping so we actually don't

722
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
even need to process that c prime we

723
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
skip it

724
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,000
what we do then is a little bit of funny

725
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,440
logic to determine within this chunk

726
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,760
what is the lowest multiple what is the

727
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,000
first multiple of the c prime

728
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
that we have uh that that we're

729
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,919
currently processing so for example for

730
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,840
the number three within the chunk that

731
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,600
we're currently processing what is the

732
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,960
first multiple of three

733
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
so we go ahead and run uh this this this

734
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
this math to figure that out and if

735
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,720
for some reason our calculation brought

736
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,120
us to a value that is lower than our

737
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,880
lower bound

738
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
then we just simply go ahead and add

739
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,799
that seed prime again that should bring

740
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,480
us into the range of low to high once

741
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,159
again this is a branchless way of

742
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,200
basically saying if low multiple less

743
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,840
than low low multiple plus equals c

744
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,279
primes i

745
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,880
except this doesn't use an if statement

746
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,360
we then go ahead and run our sieving

747
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,440
loop similar to what we had in the naive

748
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
sieve

749
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,559
that will help us mark all of the

750
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,919
multiples

751
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,120
of this seed prime as composite

752
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,039
even though we may already consider them

753
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,520
prime so what we do here

754
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,640
is we take our low multiple and if this

755
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,919
low multiple is an even number we add c

756
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,760
primes again right so if the multiple of

757
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,039
the c prime that we're looking at

758
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,279
currently happens to be an even number

759
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,440
we add the seed prime again which will

760
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,200
guarantee that we are now looking at an

761
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,559
odd number because if you take an even

762
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,559
number and you add an odd number you end

763
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,919
up with an odd number

764
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,039
after that we loop while this value is

765
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,080
less than our upper bound uh and again i

766
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,520
really don't like doing this because a

767
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,880
while loop of course means that there's

768
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,039
branching but i couldn't really find a

769
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,720
way to avoid this loop there are

770
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,960
definitely ways um to do so but this is

771
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,559
this is the code that i came up with

772
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,400
which is significantly faster than my

773
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,760
cpu code so it's still a a win there but

774
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,600
i'm looking forward to optimizing this

775
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,240
out in the future potentially

776
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,480
and then we go ahead and calculate um

777
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,799
within the chunk the index of this

778
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,679
multiple um of course where in the bit

779
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,360
array the byte and the bit that this

780
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,200
would actually be located we want to

781
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,159
figure out if it's already been set um

782
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,720
and if it has been

783
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,159
then we update uh the prime count uh

784
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,120
because

785
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,279
or in this case if it if it was already

786
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,480
set as prime uh then we want to

787
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
reduce our prime count because now we

788
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
know uh that this is composite uh and so

789
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
we can we can reduce that and then we go

790
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,799
ahead and uh

791
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,320
figure out a new value uh for the byte

792
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
inside the bit array containing this

793
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,360
value uh if it needs to be updated and

794
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,440
then we use this branchless logic to

795
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
determine what the new value should be

796
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,120
so if it was already set as prime

797
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,039
then we want to use this potential new

798
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,080
value if it was not set as prime then we

799
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,559
want to continue to use the old value

800
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,799
that was already in the bit array this

801
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,279
is the branchless logic we use for that

802
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,760
then we go ahead and add our c prime

803
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,559
multiplied by 2 to j why are we

804
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,640
multiplying by 2 well think about it we

805
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
know that j is an odd number we know

806
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
that this c prime is an odd number

807
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,159
because it's a prime odd plus odd that

808
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,840
means even but we want to skip all the

809
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,600
evens so we multiply by 2 to make this

810
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,520
an even number meaning that when we add

811
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,600
it to our odd number we get an odd

812
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,279
number so we skip the multiple that we

813
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,679
know would have been an even number so

814
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,559
that's just a little bit of an

815
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,000
optimization meaning that we only need

816
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,279
to deal with half of the primes or or

817
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,600
really values in the chunk at all

818
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,200
then we would have had to if we weren't

819
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,960
doing so

820
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,600
then when all is finally said and done

821
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
we go ahead and update the prime count

822
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,799
in the prime counts array

823
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,120
and there we go that's the gpu kernel

824
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,720
that it might have looked a little

825
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,799
intimidating but really when you break

826
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,240
it down the logic is quite i wouldn't

827
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
say straightforward

828
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
but it makes sense you know according to

829
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,360
according to the logic that i've already

830
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,679
described previously

831
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,520
then i just have another function this

832
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,919
is effectively the same thing as what we

833
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,320
just covered except it's not a gpu

834
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,760
kernel it is a cpu function

835
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,080
that just you know works normally on the

836
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,279
cpu

837
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,279
we use this because when we figure out

838
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,360
from the gpu

839
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
how many primes there are in each chunk

840
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,679
then we need to receive the chunk that

841
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,919
contains the nth prime and we want to do

842
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,919
that on the cpu because it's wasteful to

843
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,240
invoke the entire gpu kernel just for a

844
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,679
single chunk so we want to do that on

845
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,159
the cpu

846
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,440
next we have our logic that helps us

847
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,440
to distribute work across gpus so we

848
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,880
have this structure over here that i

849
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
defined

850
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,600
which contains information for a gpu

851
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,159
worker thread so uh effectively for each

852
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,520
gpu i spawn a new cpu worker thread to

853
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,320
handle that gpu in particular uh the

854
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,799
input to any given worker is of course

855
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,279
the gpu index that it must deal with uh

856
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,039
the size of the chunks that it will deal

857
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,360
with how many chunks this worker needs

858
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,440
to deal with the chunk offset which is

859
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,360
what i described previously

860
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,120
and the chunk prime count which is our

861
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,960
maximum sort of upper bound of how many

862
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
primes are possible per chunk

863
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
we also need to be past the seed primes

864
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
and how many there are as well as the

865
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,559
output array which is where we are

866
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,520
expected to deliver back into sort of

867
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,760
this array how many primes were found

868
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
per chunk once again if there's

869
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,039
five chunks then there's going to be

870
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,120
five values in this array each one will

871
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,919
be expected to set to how many primes

872
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,559
are within the respective chunks once

873
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,519
the gpu kernel's done being invoked

874
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,720
and then there's of course also an

875
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
atomic variable this is shared across

876
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
the gpu workers this is actually one

877
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,200
common atomic variable that we pass to

878
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,559
all the workers

879
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,159
and this is how many chunks have been

880
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,679
processed so far so if you need to

881
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,039
process

882
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,039
a million chunks

883
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,039
then

884
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
as as the trunks are being processed we

885
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
update this atomic variable from all the

886
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,480
different threads so the main thread can

887
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,559
print out a log of how many chunks have

888
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,760
been processed so far

889
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,480
once we have that structure defined we

890
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,440
can finally go ahead and run our worker

891
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
function our worker function is simply

892
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,360
responsible

893
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,760
for handling the invocation of the gpu

894
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,440
kernel making sure it gets all of its

895
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
input correctly making sure it's fed

896
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,799
taking a look at what it says and

897
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,760
delivering that output back to the main

898
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,519
thread so let's go ahead and take a look

899
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,799
at how it works

900
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,799
so we have this function called process

901
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,679
trunks on gpu it takes uh the worker

902
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,760
input and returns a void pointer this

903
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,919
just we just need to conform

904
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,640
to this uh particular sort of function

905
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,880
signature because uh this will be

906
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,799
invoked via p thread

907
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,480
and p thread expects us uh to uh to have

908
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,640
this specific function signature so we

909
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
go ahead and cast the void pointer input

910
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,519
into gpu worker pointer uh gpu worker

911
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,760
input pointer

912
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,440
and then we go ahead and start real

913
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,000
logic we first call into the cuda api to

914
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
set the device to the correct gpu index

915
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,080
that we're expected to work on

916
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,000
and then we start allocating some memory

917
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
so

918
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,120
the first thing we do is figure out how

919
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,720
many chunks the kernel is actually going

920
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
to deal with and this effectively boils

921
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,919
down to how many threads and how many

922
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,600
blocks we're invoking based off of the

923
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,799
um defines that i had set up ah in in

924
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,840
the code

925
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,320
um we then also go ahead and calculate

926
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,799
how many invocations we're going to need

927
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,760
um and so this is obviously starting off

928
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,679
at one because we need at least one

929
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,279
invocation of the kernel we can't have

930
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,519
half an indication

931
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,039
however from there we need to do some

932
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,960
math to figure out how many times we

933
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
actually need to invoke the kernel based

934
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,200
off of how many chunks we have to deal

935
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,159
with

936
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,559
so for example if we need to calculate

937
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,919
more chunks than threads times blocks um

938
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,279
then we need to invoke the kernel

939
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,760
multiple times in order to deal with all

940
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,279
of the chunks that we need so if the

941
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,880
input chunk count is less than the

942
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,399
kernel chunk count meaning one

943
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,639
invocation deals with

944
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,359
more data than we actually need

945
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,599
then we're already good to go we only

946
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,119
need one invocation and we're going to

947
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,960
set the kernel chart count to just the

948
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,720
input chunk count because that's all we

949
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,560
need to do uh however if the in if if

950
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,000
this is not the case if the chunk count

951
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,359
is greater than what the kernel can do

952
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,359
in one indication then we update

953
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,280
invocations and we say it's equal to the

954
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,679
input chunk count divided by the kernel

955
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,960
chunk count

956
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,720
which is our sort of base value here but

957
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,480
remember this is integer division so we

958
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,320
are uh truncating decimal um and then

959
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,399
so in order to deal with that we then

960
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,000
check if um the uh input chunk count is

961
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,399
divisible by the kernel chunk count and

962
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,320
if it is not then we add an extra

963
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,599
invocation because we know there's going

964
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,760
to be some leftover that we also need to

965
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,480
deal with in one final invocation we

966
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
then go ahead and allocate the memory

967
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,599
for the seed primes on the gpu

968
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,599
so the um

969
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,680
we already have the actual seed primes

970
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
from our input here but this is

971
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,079
allocating the memory on the gpu and

972
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,680
then we go ahead and copy over the

973
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,920
memory from the cpu to the gpu we then

974
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,760
allocate the memory for the bit arrays

975
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,560
to keep track of composite versus prime

976
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,880
and we go ahead and allocate the memory

977
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,599
for the prime counts uh so the gpu can

978
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,320
tell us how many primes found per chunk

979
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,400
we keep track of how many chunks we've

980
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,800
totally processed so far we loop through

981
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
according to the number of invocations

982
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,839
that we've pre-calculated that we will

983
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,280
need we determine our offset uh sort of

984
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
locally

985
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,280
based off of the kernel chunk count

986
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,040
because of course we start off at zero

987
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
but as we invoke we wanna

988
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
sort of increase our offset uh based off

989
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
of how many chunks we've processed in

990
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,000
the kernel indications before we then go

991
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,839
ahead and calculate how many uh

992
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,920
remaining chunks there are really this

993
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,000
variable is how many chunks we're going

994
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,280
to process in this invocation um and so

995
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,440
it starts off by default being equal to

996
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,280
the chunk count minus the offset and the

997
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,040
offset being how many we've already

998
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,839
processed basically um and

999
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,480
what we do here is if this value ends up

1000
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,000
being greater than the kernel chunk

1001
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,839
count then we go ahead and set the

1002
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,079
remaining chunks to the kernel chunk

1003
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,440
count um so if this value is less than

1004
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,359
that then that's totally fine that's

1005
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,720
just how many we need to do that's sort

1006
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,160
of like our leftover and the last

1007
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,880
invocation however if it is greater than

1008
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,240
how many we can do in an invocation then

1009
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,720
we're like okay we can only do kernel

1010
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,800
chunk count for this specific loop

1011
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,160
iteration

1012
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,560
we then go ahead and add the chunk

1013
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,160
offset that we have from our input into

1014
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,839
the offset to make sure that the gpus

1015
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,680
don't duplicate each other's work and

1016
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,240
then we invoke sieve chunk gpu with all

1017
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,640
of the input that we've previously uh

1018
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,040
specified i then just for safety go

1019
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,520
ahead and do a cuda device synchronize

1020
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,359
which will make it that we wait for this

1021
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,280
kernel to be finished executing before

1022
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,839
we continue our code i then copy over

1023
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,640
the prime counts from the gpu

1024
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,760
here into the cpu device to host

1025
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
we then keep track of how many chunks

1026
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,000
we've processed so far and we even

1027
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,440
update the atomic variable uh so that we

1028
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,680
can print out a log in the main thread

1029
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,839
when we're finally done we coulda free

1030
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,680
all the cuda memory that we allocated

1031
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,280
and return no

1032
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,320
finally

1033
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,480
the function that ties it all together

1034
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,119
that invokes all of our rather spawns

1035
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,440
all of our cpu worker threads and

1036
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,079
enables this application to work let's

1037
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,000
take a look so in essence what this

1038
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,920
function is doing is it's tying together

1039
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
all the functionality that we've

1040
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,280
described so far the idea of the

1041
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,839
function is to help us actually find the

1042
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,960
nth or i guess in this case m prime

1043
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
um what this function does is it takes

1044
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
the number m

1045
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,359
this is for this is as i mentioned which

1046
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,359
which prime we would like to find so if

1047
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,720
we wanted to find for example the

1048
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,560
millionth prime and would be equal to a

1049
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,680
million

1050
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,720
we then go ahead and do some

1051
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,119
calculations this is because the seed c

1052
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,440
veritostomies doesn't let us just say

1053
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
hey give me the millionth prime instead

1054
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,720
the civil fairtosthenes has us go up to

1055
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,359
a number and it'll tell us which numbers

1056
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,160
up until that number are our prime this

1057
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,680
is somewhat problematic for this use

1058
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,119
case so what we have to do is a little

1059
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,440
bit of math the math in this particular

1060
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,119
case is to approximate an upper bound

1061
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,720
for what the largest possible number is

1062
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,800
that could be the nth prime

1063
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
and this is the math to do that there's

1064
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,320
actually multiple ways of calculating

1065
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,079
this this is like a simpler way of doing

1066
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,079
it and basically what this will tell us

1067
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,000
is if you wanted to find say the

1068
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,599
millionth prime

1069
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,800
this number is guaranteed to be greater

1070
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,079
than or equal to the millionth prime um

1071
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,480
it may be you know quite a bit over the

1072
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,320
millionth prime so you may end up over

1073
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,680
calculating a little bit and maybe

1074
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,079
finding a couple thousand extra primes

1075
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,440
than you wanted to

1076
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,280
but it's better than not finding the

1077
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,359
millionth prime at all

1078
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,119
and so what we do is we calculate all

1079
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,720
the primes up until this number and then

1080
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,800
we count we find the millionth and then

1081
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,760
we return the millionth in specific

1082
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,960
of course though we don't just want to

1083
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,720
sieve all the way up to the upper bound

1084
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
because that would be very slow so we

1085
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
chunk it up we square root the upper

1086
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,800
bound that is our chunk size and our

1087
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,119
chunk count is literally just that minus

1088
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,440
one because the first chunk from two to

1089
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
the square root of n we're doing

1090
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,040
manually and using that as our seed

1091
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,599
primes our chunk prime count which is

1092
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,440
our sort of upper bound sort of like per

1093
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,920
chunk how many primes you can have is

1094
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,079
just the chunk size divided by two and

1095
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,880
potentially one more if the chunk size

1096
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,040
is an odd number from there we just go

1097
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,280
ahead and log how many uh chunks we

1098
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,760
actually have to deal with um and what

1099
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,440
the upper bound is uh for the um

1100
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,160
for the like m prime in this case

1101
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
and then we go ahead and start doing

1102
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,920
some actual logic so we start with

1103
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,960
calculating the seed primes um which is

1104
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,800
a simple naive sieve

1105
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,920
and then we go ahead and start

1106
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,240
distributing work across the gpu so we

1107
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
start by calculating how many chunks

1108
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,200
need to be dealt with per gpu and if the

1109
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,640
chunk count is not divisible by the

1110
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
number of gpus then how many chunks will

1111
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,359
need to be uh dealt with by the last gpu

1112
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,640
as extra versus the other gpu so it's

1113
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
not a totally even distribution of work

1114
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,520
it's really just we assign you know a

1115
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,560
chunk to each gpu and the last gpu gets

1116
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,520
however many is remaining basically

1117
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,560
we then go ahead and create the um array

1118
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,839
of arrays

1119
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,760
that will contain the prime counts from

1120
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,200
the gpus so this is an array of count

1121
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,079
gpus where each value is a pointer to an

1122
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,000
unsigned 64-bit integer which is really

1123
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,920
just an array that we keep track of

1124
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,720
using

1125
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,200
using using memory allocation

1126
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,440
we also keep track of all the input that

1127
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,079
we're giving our gpu workers uh through

1128
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,319
a similar sort of stack allocated array

1129
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,880
and then also the uh p thread sort of

1130
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,240
handles um the thread ids on a similar

1131
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,280
stack allocated array for each gpu we

1132
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,599
then create our atomic integer telling

1133
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,440
us how many chunks have been processed

1134
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,599
so far we then go ahead and loop through

1135
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,280
the number of gpus that we actually need

1136
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,200
to start working with

1137
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,000
we count the number of chunks per gpu

1138
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,680
that we need to deal with and of course

1139
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,440
if this is the last gpu we add the

1140
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,599
overflow that we may have

1141
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,880
we then go ahead and allocate uh the

1142
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,359
prime counts array for this specific

1143
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,520
worker uh we need to call lock it so

1144
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,160
that it's clean uh and then once that's

1145
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,079
done we put together our input which is

1146
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,680
just the type that i had specified

1147
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,000
previously gpu worker input

1148
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,520
and then we go ahead and invoke the

1149
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,560
function uh we do so using pthat create

1150
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,520
so that we launch the gpu worker

1151
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,760
function on a new thread and then on the

1152
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,839
main thread we simply keep looking at

1153
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,480
this atomic variable and while it's less

1154
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,680
than the total number of chunks that

1155
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,359
needs to be processed we just print

1156
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,800
however many chunks have been processed

1157
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,640
so far and we sleep because we don't

1158
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,160
want this to be um a a a lock we don't

1159
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,480
want this to be a spin lock here we want

1160
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,359
to allow the kernel to use the cpu for

1161
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,760
other things for 100 milliseconds

1162
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,319
while we wait for this atomic variable

1163
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,720
to update then we just print a new line

1164
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,200
so that we can uh flush out the the the

1165
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,119
logs um we go ahead and join with the uh

1166
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,640
other cpu threads that are actually

1167
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,560
dealing with the the work just to make

1168
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,240
sure that they're genuinely finished

1169
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,920
before we start looking at their work

1170
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,760
once again this is for safety and then

1171
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,680
we run the logic that helps us figure

1172
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,720
out which chunk actually contained the m

1173
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,760
prime

1174
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
so we start off by

1175
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,200
logging out how many chunks we've

1176
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,680
checked so far and how many primes we've

1177
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,920
seen this is by default equal to the

1178
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,599
seed prime count because of course that

1179
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,119
is how many primes we have already seen

1180
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,839
in the in the process of checking

1181
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,000
we then go ahead and loop through all of

1182
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,760
the chunks the way we have to do this is

1183
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,560
by looping through all the gpus figuring

1184
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,400
out how many chunks that gpu would have

1185
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
had to deal with based off of the gpu

1186
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,480
index and the overflow and then looping

1187
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,560
through that number of chunks so these

1188
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,480
two loops effectively boil down to a

1189
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,560
one-dimensional loop over all the chunks

1190
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
that were dealt with across sorry worked

1191
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,839
on across all the gpus so then for every

1192
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,920
chunk basically we take a look at

1193
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,520
however many primes were found within

1194
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,599
the chunk we add that to how many primes

1195
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,560
we've seen so far and if this new added

1196
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,079
value suddenly meets or exceeds the

1197
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,240
value that we're looking for we know

1198
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,319
that we've found the empty prime

1199
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,640
in this case we go to foundchunk which

1200
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,119
is this this label here but if we have

1201
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,200
not met that value yet we just update

1202
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,280
however many primes we found update the

1203
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,839
number of chunks checked and loop over

1204
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,160
and over again if we end these loops

1205
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
without doing this go to we know that

1206
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,079
for some reason we couldn't find the m

1207
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,319
prime could be that the gpu kernels

1208
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,480
didn't invoke properly our math is wrong

1209
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,920
something but we couldn't find it so we

1210
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,359
just go to clean up

1211
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,319
however

1212
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,839
in all normal runs of this program you

1213
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,800
should end up going to file chunk

1214
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,440
now you know that um total chunks

1215
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,280
checked is the index of the chunk

1216
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,440
that contains the m prime so what we do

1217
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,680
is we create a bit array and we see that

1218
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,800
specific chunk once again on the cpu

1219
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,760
once we do that we loop through

1220
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,920
this new bit array that we've created

1221
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,560
and right as we find the empty prime

1222
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,319
based off of the markers whereas we find

1223
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,640
it we go ahead and print it out and we

1224
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,680
break

1225
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,319
and just like that we found the amp

1226
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,240
prime all we got to do now

1227
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,800
is free our memory the reason we don't

1228
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,720
free this in cleanup is because this

1229
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,880
will only have been allocated within the

1230
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,400
found chunk label

1231
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,480
through this function call otherwise

1232
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
that would have been

1233
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,160
as far as i know either undefined

1234
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,480
functionality or it's just um

1235
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,319
it will just ignore your free if you try

1236
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,880
to free a null pointer um but now to

1237
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,160
think about it you actually shouldn't do

1238
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,440
that because this is not going to be a

1239
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,640
null point or this is going to be a

1240
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,160
garbage pointer because it's just stack

1241
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,319
allocated so the logic is correct you

1242
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,240
want to free within found chunk

1243
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,440
wonderful and then we've just got a

1244
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,520
really simple main function all we do is

1245
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,920
we get the current time of day run the c

1246
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,440
function get the time of day again and

1247
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
then print out how many seconds it took

1248
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,000
for us to do the actual seating um now

1249
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,280
we're going to start off with something

1250
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,440
a little less ham here

1251
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
this is this is quite a bit uh for for a

1252
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
first invocation so

1253
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,880
let's go ahead and actually take a look

1254
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,400
at the code running shall we i'm going

1255
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,960
to do so within my docker container here

1256
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,440
i've got a fresh one

1257
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,119
and so this is

1258
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,520
this actually lets us run nvidia smi

1259
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,839
i've got the code over here well let's

1260
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,200
go ahead and quickly update it

1261
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,200
i'm going to need vim for that

1262
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,560
all right so let's go ahead and update

1263
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,640
the code quickly to save a more

1264
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,240
reasonable number let's just say we

1265
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,440
wanted to find

1266
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,240
the one millionth prime so what we do is

1267
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,000
we update the code

1268
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,800
we

1269
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,560
run the compile command

1270
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,160
and i will explain this in just a moment

1271
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,599
so basically

1272
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,640
actually let's go through the compile

1273
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,079
command first so what this is saying is

1274
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,440
we're saying run the nvidia akua

1275
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,520
compiler um and we're passing it 03 for

1276
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,000
the c plus code and then for the cuda

1277
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,760
code we're also telling it to optimize

1278
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,839
that and we're saying output to a binary

1279
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,400
file called sieve and when you run it um

1280
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,920
it's telling you that hey to find the

1281
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,560
millionth prime i actually deceive up

1282
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,680
until 16441

1283
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,760
301 which means i need to process

1284
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,200
4053 chunks

1285
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,960
but it was able to go ahead and process

1286
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,560
all of them so fast that it didn't even

1287
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,280
actually log them

1288
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,720
and there we go we find that the

1289
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,680
millionth prime is 15485

1290
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,520
863 which we can go ahead and validate

1291
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,760
by going to the nth prime page pasting

1292
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,520
it in and it should tell us

1293
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,319
that

1294
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,720
indeed

1295
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,200
there are 1 million primes less than or

1296
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,319
equal to

1297
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,560
15 million four hundred and eighty five

1298
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,480
thousand eight hundred and sixty three

1299
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,760
let's go ahead and scale this up a bit

1300
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
shall we this was this was fun um of

1301
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,920
course i don't wanna vim a binary file

1302
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,319
uh but we did a million

1303
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,160
let's let's even skip ten million let's

1304
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,880
just go directly to a hundred million so

1305
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,640
i'm going to recompile the code we're

1306
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,920
going to run

1307
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,800
and there we go just like that in 0.4

1308
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,200
seconds we find the 100 millionth prime

1309
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,040
which i can paste in oh didn't want to

1310
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,720
copy i wanted to paste

1311
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,319
so i'm going to go ahead and do that

1312
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,960
let's see if there we go the 100

1313
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,480
millionth prime

1314
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,800
now let's really go crazy so let's go

1315
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,079
ahead and calculate the 10 billionth

1316
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,960
prime number

1317
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,119
all right

1318
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,359
let's see here we have to process 511

1319
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:03,280
491 chunks that's quite a bit that means

1320
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,200
that we are sieving up until let me see

1321
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,240
if i can read this properly

1322
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,720
261 billion 624 million 684

1323
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,960
681 that is our upper bound for how

1324
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,400
large the 10 billionth prime can be

1325
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,640
so as you can see the gpus are making

1326
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,599
quick work of this and in just 26

1327
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,920
seconds just over 26 seconds we're able

1328
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,440
to calculate

1329
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,480
see here

1330
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,920
verify that this is indeed the 10

1331
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,559
billionth prime there we go

1332
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,040
just like that multi gpu segmented sea

1333
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,079
of veritostones to find the nth prime

1334
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,160
number i hope you enjoyed thank you very

1335
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,760
much everybody for joining in today code

1336
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,119
will be in the description feel free to

1337
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,559
let me know if you have any feedback

1338
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,319
ideas on how to optimize there's always

1339
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,640
ways to make this better i'm by no means

1340
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,480
an absolute you know expert in the field

1341
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,200
of gpu programming um that is an

1342
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,440
insanely complicated field and i'm sure

1343
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,200
there's ways to make this better so let

1344
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,480
me know if you have any ideas down in

1345
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,839
the comment section below or any

1346
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,000
