then we'll see the need for express js
after that we'll see the features of x
plus js moving ahead we'll see the
advantages and disadvantages of express
js and then we'll see the companies that
are using express.js
nodejs is a far javascript runtime
environment but it does not support
request handling functions http methods
or serving files
so expressjs comes into the picture
express makes the node.js code easier
as express provides a wide range of
features to develop both web and mobile
applications it is used to build single
page multi-page and hybrid page web
applications as express is written in
javascript it is very easy to understand
for the developers who know javascript
until now express is the most popular
framework of node.js
you must have heard about main stack in
web development right
where e stands for express.js
it is a backend part of means tag
it manages routing http method sessions
error handling etc
let's see what express js is
express js is a node.js framework
designed to build api's web applications
cross platform mobile apps quickly and
easily
it is very high performance
fast
lightweight and unopenated that is there
is no structural way to write a code
express does not force you to write a
code in a fixed manner
express js is used as a server-side
scripting language
let's see the need for express js but
before that let me give you an example
if you have to write a rest api using
the code modules of node.js and the same
using the framework express js you will
realize that with the help of express it
will take 5 to 10 times less code and
time
that was the reason behind creating
express js framework for nodejs
express.js is time efficient
fast money efficient very easy to learn
and asynchronous
let's see the features of express.js
for server side development with the
features of nodejs
saves a lot of time
middleware middleware is a request
handler that has access to the
application's request response cycle
routing this refers to how an
application's endpoints urls respond to
client requests
templating
it provides templating engines to build
dynamic content on the web pages by
creating html templates on the server
debugging
express makes it easier as it identifies
the exact part where bugs are
let's see the advantages of express.js
express is unopenated and we can
customize it and use it as per our needs
as it is written in javascript a single
language is used for front-end and
back-end development
express is fast to link it with
databases like mysql mongodb etc
let's see the disadvantages the
disadvantage of xps.js is that there is
no structural way to organize things
sometimes the code becomes
non-understandable
there are so many issues with callbacks
the error messages that will come are
very challenging to understand
now we'll see the companies that are
using express.js
the major companies are ibm uber ebay
paypal accenture fox sports netflix
linkedin
as per the nlp.com there are more than
34 300 companies that are using express
js
now
i think you guys have a brief idea about
express as it is a lightweight framework
that gives functionalities to make
node.js easy
express js is trending so much because
it is helping so many developers to save
their time it is so awesome that most of
the companies are moving towards it
if you know javascript and node.js the
framework express is what you should
know to strengthen your coding skills
and with that we have reached the end of
