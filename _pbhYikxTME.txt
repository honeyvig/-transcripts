hi traders welcome back to another
weekly market analysis video
today's video i'm going to be covering
all the major forex pairs all of the
forex pairs we covered last week
as well as a couple of other markets
like gold the s p 500
some crypto nova vaxx and the australian
stock market index
so let's start today's weekly analysis
with the most important market on my
radar right now
and that is bitcoin the reason why it's
the most important market
on my watch list at the moment is
because of what's happening here
and the fact that we are retesting the
all-time highs of bitcoin
this is very important for anyone who's
holding crypto what happens
right now will dictate what bitcoin does
for the next year or two
so over the past few weekly analysis
videos i've been pointing out
that 40k is an extremely important
number
for bitcoin it's a psychological number
it represents a doubling in price from
the previous all-time high
and it also caused this large sell-off
when we got up here initially we did
find support on this 50
ema 50-day ema which was nice to see
and since we had this big rally we've
had obviously bitcoin
rally and a lot of the old coins rally
into significant highs that they haven't
seen
in a long time however everything in the
crypto market right now is
extremely overextended and basically any
big guys
who have money on the table are looking
for any reason to sell
and take their profit one of those
reasons to sell
would be a double top at the all-time
highs of bitcoin
we have got that a couple of days ago
on the weekend i saw this double top
occur and i sold
a significant portion of my crypto
holdings i sold about 20
of my entire crypto holdings which since
this rally began has become a
significant amount of money for me at
least
now i do believe in the long term future
of crypto and a lot of my
holdings are in all coins that haven't
yet reached their full potential
i've sold my bitcoin holdings on this
double top and of course i'm willing to
buy back in if we do get that breaking
close above
42k i'm happy to give up a couple
percent
gain in order to lock in the profits
i've made so far but on my altcoin
positions
i'm being conservative i've taken off a
significant amount of money
and i've moved that money around into
other investments such as my forex
trading account
but what i'm really looking to see here
is
if we get a big selling day out of this
zone that takes out the previous day's
low
um that's a pretty bad sign for bitcoin
given where we're at let me just draw on
this double top so i class a double top
as when price actually makes a high
sells off
and then comes back up to retest the
bodies of that high
which is this red line but doesn't close
above
the initial wick high so even if this
bard closed above this red line
that would still be considered a double
top but the fact that we sold off
from this red line is a very bad sign
for the bulls
in bitcoin right now is a very very good
place to take profit
on this market if you're in profit from
this monster rally here
i'm not saying that bitcoin won't get
above 42k in the future
but it's looking very unlikely to happen
anytime soon
after we've had this double top and now
if we turn on volume
this is also an important indicator we
actually haven't had a lot of volume
at this high which is interesting so i
am expecting bitcoin to hang around
at this high for a little longer a high
volume bar
up in this high will give us more
information or more reliable information
but right now is a good time to drop
down to a four hour time frame
and keep an eye out for that one two
three move
that lower high and that lower low if
that happens out of this zone
uh we could be in trouble in the crypto
markets the crypto markets are extremely
emotional
extremely volatile and so if the selling
begins it could get quite
volatile to the downside in the short
term and who knows how long that'll last
last time this sort of situation
happened it lasted three years before we
saw new hires come in
so being very conservative on bitcoin
right now and all coins
we did get that bearish engulfing candle
up in this zone
that's a classic signal that i look for
for sell-offs
in these structure zones they're very
reliable reversal
pattern so yeah keep an eye on this
especially if we start to rally
back up to retest this high it's going
to be very important if we can get a
daily
candle close above these wicks that will
invalidate my bearish thesis altogether
so if that happens disregard everything
i've said
but if that does not happen and we start
to see selling come in here
i think this rally is over for the time
being and we're likely to see
at least another mini crypto winter come
in if not a full-on bear market
they could see us come all the way back
down to retest 20k which
apart from 30k is really the only major
major structure level looking left that
has acted as resistance
twice this 24k level is an important
level in a four hour time frame
but 20k is the real big daddy support
zone for bitcoin now
and that's only in theory it hasn't
actually acted as support yet we've only
acted as resistance a couple times
but bitcoin does have a history of
previous swing highs
acting as support so that's what i'm
expecting out of this market in the long
term
if we do see a massive sell-off i'd
expect 20k to act as support
if we don't and that would be a
best-case scenario then we're probably
just going to see a sideways market for
a while
that may trickle around 24k and 40k
so yeah i've been in the crypto markets
for a number of years now i've been
through
several ups and downs and i'm pretty
experienced now i consider myself a
crypto vet
and i have a feeling that the good times
are over for the time being
and we're going to see a cool off period
but i am bullish in the long term
so if you are just holding huddling or
whatever then that's fine
and more power to you but if you're
swing trading these markets
or you are in significant profit and you
want to lock some of that in
even if it's just to buy back in when
price action gets lower
you know if you're anti-fiat and i don't
blame you if you are i don't like fiat
myself
even though i'm a forex trader i think
fiat is uh
worthless money it's only worth
something because we say it is but then
again i guess
so is bitcoin but at least the banks
can't print bitcoin whenever they need a
little bit more money you're not going
to see inflation
affect bitcoin the way it will fiat
currencies in the decades to come
and so if you're holding this for the
long long term you probably don't need
to worry about this but if you're a
short-term trader
i'd be getting my sell orders ready for
sure and that brings me to
the next market which is kidano so this
is a cryptocurrency that i hold a lot of
i don't want to say how much because uh
you know i don't want to
become a target for hackers or something
like that but uh i have a lot of kadano
i'm a big fan of this project the team
behind it the technology i understand it
quite well
and i'm very bullish on it i believe
we're going to easily see this
reach a dollar in the years to come but
i'm skeptical that we're going to get
there
without a big sell-off yeah we haven't
had a correction yet
since we broke through 40 cents i'm
expecting this
correction to be pretty significant when
it does come in because we do not have
any structure looking left on this
market
above 37 cents so i'm not willing to
risk
that much of a decline in my holdings so
i've taken a significant amount of
profit off
at this orange line you see here which
was around the
67 cents so i didn't quite get the 70
high but i was keeping an eye on this on
the 15-minute chart
and around here um i saw rsi divergence
coming in
i knew 70 cents would be a pretty
important level just because of the
magnitude of the rally
70 cents is an even handle number
crypto is largely psychological driven
by psychology and emotions
so i started to scale out of my position
around 67 cents
but i only sold about 20 25 percent of
my position i still have a lot of
cadano in cold storage waiting for when
it hits a dollar us
um and then i'll consider selling
another significant portion
but for now i'm not trading kadano at
the moment
i'm waiting for that retracement i'll
probably buy more
if we get a nice retracement and then a
a good bullish
trend continuation opportunity maybe a
re-test of this 50 ema
could be nice but we'll have to wait and
see but right now the entire crypto
market is looking
ballistic and one signal i've learned
during my time in crypto is that when
big green days like this start to print
one after another
uh it's nearing a top people are getting
greedy exuberant they're buying at any
price they can get their hands on that's
unsustainable
eventually these retail traders these um
dumb money as the
as the bigger guys call them they're
gonna run out of money to buy this and
it's gonna roll over
right into the hands of the bigger guys
that are waiting to buy this at a
discount
at the structure levels and technical
levels so that's what i'm expecting out
of this market in the month to come this
is a bigger picture thing
in the next couple of days we could
easily see this trickle a bit higher or
even
see a flag pattern form something like
this
and we may break out again similar to
what happened here
but i'm just waiting for more
information here i'm happy to scale out
where i did
take some profit off the table and just
sit on that reinvest that
or even wait for a discount to buy back
into this market so that's it for kidano
there's not a lot of technical levels to
look at
on this us tether or any of the
stablecoin markets but against bitcoin
we do have a few key levels
one of them is this previous swing high
here
this high around 1800 satoshi's
was a major resistance level for this
market
i was expecting us to get back up here
but we didn't quite make it
before uh all of these crazy market
conditions began happening we went
massively overbought we've had this
giant
buying days recently we haven't had a
healthy correction yet
i'm willing to play it safe take off
some money here
rather than hope that we get that little
bit higher and that just makes me feel
psychologically better if we do start to
sell off
at least i've locked in a fair amount of
profit significantly
more than my initial investment or my
initial risk and to me that's what
trading is all about so that's what i'm
looking at in crypto
i follow a few other altcoins so i'm not
going to go into them today but those
two are the main
holdings for me bitcoin and cadano all
right so here we are on euro dollar
last week i was pointing out this key
support zone i said that if we got below
this zone we were likely to head lower
and that is exactly what happened so we
did get a couple of bounces out of this
previous support zone the market rallied
here pulled back
and then broke into new highs this
support level
became an important level as this 50 ema
came up in the confluence with it this
zone pushed the market higher
there was a nice trading opportunity in
there but after this happened
i was no longer looking to go long from
the zone
because once it gets tested a couple of
times and given the fact that we had
this lower high print as price action
came back down into the zone
uh that basically invalidates the zone
for me now and i was
really expecting this market to just
kind of go sideways and
uh just consolidate between these
heights but that didn't end up happening
what happened instead is these lows gave
way
we got to close below and then the
market rolled over so now i consider the
euro dollar to be in a bearish trend
because we've had this one two three
move that broke this previous swing low
we have a lower high
i'm expecting this to continue i don't
know for sure if it will
but it's more likely to continue heading
lower now
so with that being the case where do i
think it's likely to head lower to
down into this zone here and we've
already tested the high of this zone
but i am expecting a retest could be
wrong about that we could see this
market completely rally out of this zone
and shoot up
but i am expecting a re-test of this low
now we did have a pretty big bullish day
here that retraced
two of the previous days nearly three of
the previous days bearish price action
it's a pretty big green day here so that
gives me reason to believe this market
may head a little bit higher yet
back up to the bodies of this zone here
and maybe even this
50-day ema so we may have a few more
green days here before we get that
re-test of the lows and the way i
personally trade this approach to
technical analysis
of identifying the trend and structure
levels
is i use these structure levels
primarily for taking profit
if i'm riding the trend so i'm a trend
continuation trader
i'm looking for a chance to jump on this
bearish trend and ride it
down to the next level of major support
which for me is around
119.3 the way i
approach that is i have systematic
strategies that are back tested over
historical data over thousands of trades
to prove it has an edge over the markets
and the way i love to trade trend
continuation
on these high time frames like the daily
and weekly chart is to use a four hour
time frame
to identify trading opportunities with
an edge so that i can jump on
this trend so right now on my chart i
have two moving averages
this stepped moving average is the daily
50 ema that's drawing over my intraday
time frame
this thinner ema is the four hour or
whatever time frame i'm on
at the moment this is the four hour 50
ema one of the strategies i like to take
advantage of
is basically just trading bearish
engulfing candles
swing high bearish engulfing candles
that occur below this 50 ema
with the hopes of capturing trend
continuation from that higher time frame
earlier today the reason this profit
taking tool this
position tool is on my chart is because
i had a valid trading setup
setting up this morning but literally in
the very last
minute of this candles trading session
the bar closed invalid and i couldn't
enter this trade
so in the past things like this would
happen and i would just enter the trade
anyway because i was
eager to get involved in the markets but
over the years i've learned that's a
terrible way to trade
never works out that's called chasing
the market or
forcing trades you see these trading
setup
that i have back tested with this
particular strategy depends on bearish
engulfing candles
i need this bar to close lower than the
previous bars open
that is the price action pattern i back
tested over thousands of trades and
found to be profitable
i did not back test candles that almost
closed as bearish engulfing candles that
was not included in my back testing
data so this may be a profitable pattern
i don't know
uh and that's the point i don't know if
it's profitable or not i don't know
what the approximate percentage chance
of winning this trade is
and therefore i can't take it it's not a
valid trading setup according to my
rules
and so i can delete this profit tool and
now i just wait
for a price action pattern that does
meet my rules so if this market can
rally
and retest this 50 ema with a
higher high than this bar and then i get
a bearish engulfing candle
then i can enter that trade with a stop
loss above the swing high
my first target at a one to one if the
market rolls over and hits that target
i can move my stop loss to break even
and trail my stop-loss
down into this zone where i plan to take
profits but if none of that happens if i
don't get a valid trading setup
i don't get involved on this analysis
and i simply move on to the next market
which is what we're about to do
but before we move on one other way i
can take advantage of this market
is if this four hour time frame does
break above this 50 ema
and we get either a there's a couple of
trading setups i look for in these zones
i'm not going to go
over all of them today because this
video will be too long
but one of them for example would be a
double top on a one-hour chart
if i get that price action pattern in
this zone in this red zone
then i can go short i have a second
opportunity a second chance
to capture this potential bearish trend
continuation and so there's a quick
lesson in
patience discipline trade what the
market is
telling you not what you want to see out
of the market
the market right here told me that this
trading setup that i was looking for
did not happen and therefore i cannot
get involved in this market
but that's fine because i have literally
dozens of other markets i can trade
potential trading opportunities on so
that's it for euro dollar
in order to consider this a trend
reversal i need to see a one two three
move
that breaks the swing high and clears
out of this
red zone so until that happens i'm
bearish on eurodollar
stalking short trades let's move on now
here we are on usn
now i am in fact involved in a short
trade on this market because i did get a
trading
opportunity that i've back tested found
to be profitable
within this zone and we'll drop down to
a four hour chart in a moment
and i'll go over why i've entered short
on this market but before i do that i
should explain why this zone here this
resistance zone was important to me so
this resistance zone at around 105.5
has acted as resistance and support
multiple times looking left when this
market is above this zone
it tends to act to support and push the
market out of it
when this market gets below this zone it
tends to push the market down
and so this is a key structure level
that i'm expecting
a pullback from that being said this is
a counter trend trade
unlike euro dollar we are not testing a
structure level
that is in trend on this daily chart
this market
according to my analysis is now in a
bullish trend because we've had this one
two three move
with an initial high a high low
and a higher high however this higher
high
has come overbought right up into this
structure level here looking left i'm
expecting
a pullback similar to this one here from
this zone
so i'm being conservative with my
targets i am expecting this market to
continue higher
but in the medium term in the short term
i feel like this market
is a bit overextended to the upside but
what i feel
is irrelevant that's not why i entered
short here i entered short here because
i got a trading setup
price action pattern on this four hour
chart that meets
my trading rules so we've come up into
this zone on this four hour time frame
this zone on a daily chart is a major
structure resistance zone
potential major structure resistance
zone and we got this large bearish
engulfing candle that closed below
the proceeding candle this is a valid
price action pattern within this zone
that i'm happy to go short on if i'm
wrong i take a small loss
if i'm right i could capture a nice two
target winner
out of this trade so i entered short
this morning
at the market with my stop loss one atr
above the swing high
i have a one to one profit target on my
first position
which happens to be above this 50 4-hour
ema which is always nice
because when something like this is
happening these 54-hour emas tend to act
as support
and we don't really have any structure
on this time frame looking left i don't
count any of these
swing eyes in here as structure the most
major level of structure i see on this
chart
would be these swing lows in here just
because price action hung around there
for a while
and these swing highs up in here that
were previous resistance
so there's plenty of meat on this
trading opportunity i'm happy to take it
happy to risk my two percent per trade
on this trade and i'm expecting this
market to have
a temporary sell-off before we head
higher
again if this happens and we come back
up into this resistance zone this could
be a good spot to look for a double top
or
if we just blow straight through this
zone it could be a good zone to look for
trend continuation like we are looking
for
or like i am looking for on euro dollar
of course this is not trading
advice this is just what i'm doing with
my own money with my own experience
and this is all for educational purposes
only and this is intended to
educate you on how you should approach
trading if you want to be a consistently
profitable
systematic rules-based trader the best
part about being a systematic
rules-based trader
is there's no confusion there's no
question of whether i should enter this
trade
i know this trading setup has an edge
over the markets and so i'm comfortable
entering it
if i'm wrong i'm wrong take a small loss
move on if that's the way you would like
to learn how to trade then i'll include
a link in the video description
to a long lesson i did over a year ago
now on back testing how to back test
trading strategies to prove they work
and so if you're interested in that
check out the video description below
that's it for dollar yen these are the
two levels i'm looking at
if we do continue higher and i lose this
trade
this market continues higher the next
structure level i'd be looking
to trade around would be up around here
reason for that is multiple tests of
resistance support
looking left so that's what i'm looking
for on
usn let's move on to the next market
here we have pound dollar
i'm just going to quickly gloss over
this one because this is planning out
exactly how i expected from last week
i said that we were testing two major
resistance and support zones
these are too close together for me to
want to trade because the risk reward
profile is just not there for me
since i'm a four-hour trader primarily
and i didn't get a trading opportunity
in this zone anyway if i drop down to a
four-hour chart um
i can't enter on this bar here it's way
too big and so that's why i'm not
interested in trading this zone there's
just not enough space between the two
and i'll be back in a second i'm getting
a delivery these are the things that
happen when you work from home
all right so what i'm looking for on
this market going into the next couple
of weeks is i i'd rather see
this zone get broken and capture a trend
continuation retest
than to look for a short trade in the
zone because it's been tested
so many times here and we've got such
momentum
in this trend now coming off this
structure zone we've got big green
candles
large wick i'm expecting this market to
break out higher
and so i'm stalking long trades but i'm
not looking to go long until we clear
these highs
and i'm also not looking for long trades
down here so i'm just sitting on my
hands here
waiting for this market to either give
me that trend continuation opportunity
or to find resistance here come down
break through this
support zone get below this 50 ema and
then i'll start stalking short trading
opportunities
until either of these scenarios unfold
i'm just sitting on my hands on pound
dollar
let's move on to the next market which
is aussie dollar now aussie dollar had a
really nice trading opportunity in here
if you go back and watch last week's
video i was talking about how this 50
ema was likely to act as support since
we haven't tested it
in a while and we are in a very strong
bullish
trend even though we've consolidated
here i class
all of this price action here as just a
pullback
in this bullish trend until we break and
close below this swing low
this trend is intact and we came down
close to this low but we found support
on the 50 ema
and we're now rallying so this is the
power of having a higher time frame
directional bias
and then dropping down to lower time
frames to capture those trading
opportunities
on that higher time frame so if we drop
down a four hour chart
you'll see what trading opportunity i'm
talking about here
very nice clean double bottom
off this 50 day ema remember this
stepped ema
is a 50 day ema this thin one is the 54
hour ema
so i was actually short on this market
on this four hour time frame
because we had this one two three move
to the downside
i had my trading set up here bearish
engulfing candle below the 50 ema
my target was around here and price
actually got so close to it it got
within
10 so it was 90 of the way to my
take profit when that happens according
to my rules and how i've back tested i'm
allowed to move my stop loss to break
even
and so we got lucky on this trade and i
was not stopped out
for a loss but that means i couldn't
take advantage of this double bottom
down here because i was already involved
in a short trade and according to my
rules once i'm involved in a trade i
cannot
reverse my position until that trade is
played out
and in this case i missed out on a nice
double bottom that would have hit first
targets by now this is a one to one risk
reward with a one atr stop loss below
this
initial swing low nice double bottom
with a bullish engulfing candle would
have made for a great structure-based
trading opportunity
but i was already involved in this short
trade and that happens in trading that's
something that took me a long time to
learn
you know often in trading if you have
multiple strategies multiple ways of
taking advantage of a market
then you will often get conflicting
signals so you need to come up with
rules
governing what you're going to do in a
situation like that so that you don't
make your decisions based on emotional
stimulus so in this case i missed out on
a winning trade but i didn't lose money
on this initial short trade anytime you
don't lose money on a trade
just means you have more gas in the tank
for the next trading opportunity
so it doesn't bother me and now that
we've had this one two three move
got this initial low initial high higher
low
higher high i can now look for pullback
trading opportunities on this four hour
time frame
to capture a rally out of this support
zone
so we'll see how that unfolds this week
that's what i'm looking for uh if you
were just a structure based trader and
you weren't trading trend continuation
on this four hour time frame
you could have taken advantage of this
double bottom down here but if you're
like me
and you missed this trading opportunity
you can now start looking
for potential uh bullish trend
continuation
trading opportunities on this four hour
time frame because remember
on the daily chart we do have a very
nice and healthy
bullish trend here we have this very
large reaction
of this 50-day ema even if we do see a
little bit of selling here
it's likely that we're going to break
through this previous support level
and head higher so that's what i'm
expecting out of aussie dollar
in the weeks to come again i could be
wrong about that that's why we use stop
losses but that's what i'm expecting out
of this market and that's what i am
looking to trade
on aussie dollar going forward so that's
it for aussie dollar let's quickly jump
through these next few pairs a u.s cad
not much to say here same as last week
we are finding resistance on this 50-day
ema we've only closed above it once and
then
we're immediately rejected twice and
then immediately rejected
this market is in a downtrend according
to my analysis until we break above
breaking close above this swing high in
here which happens to be also a major
structure resistance level
till that happens i'm expecting this
market to continue lower and that
appears to be what's unfolding here
unfortunately there's no way for me to
take advantage of this trading
opportunity
because we didn't get quite high enough
for a structure-based trade
and on the four hour time frame i need
this swing load to be broken
before i can look at any trades as
potentially valid
so i'm just sitting on my hands on us
cad this week
until we either get so low that we test
this structure support level again
or we get back up into this structure
resistance level which again
has acted as resistance support and
support
multiple times looking left that's why
i'm paying attention
to this zone here so let's move on to us
swiss
franc which had another great trading
opportunity in this structure resistance
zone that i pointed out last week
so last week i was saying how u.s swiss
is now
in a bullish trend according to my
analysis
we have this initial low initial high
high low higher high i'm expecting this
market to continue higher
however there are places on this chart
where price action is likely to see a
selling pressure come in
this red resistance zone was one of them
the reason for that should be pretty
obvious looking at this chart
it's been tested as support multiple
times
looking left this is the first time
we've retested it since we broke through
it
we've all heard the saying previous
support turns resistance
more often than not especially when it's
a clean level like this
and that's what we're seeing happening
here now i'm not expecting a
full-on trend reversal from this
sell-off but this
zone does provide for some nice training
opportunities and that's what we got
down here on this four hour time frame
so unfortunately on friday i was unable
to be
at my computer i had other commitments
that day
and so i actually missed out on this
trade normally i would
have alerts set and i would have been
notified about this trade but on
last friday i had family over and a
friend's birthday to prepare for and so
i just ended up
taking the day off and unfortunately
that was the day that i missed out on
this nice
trading opportunity why is this a nice
trading opportunity
because we have rallied up into this
major
resistance level on the daily time frame
and we have gone dramatically overbought
on this
four hour rsi then we've got a bearish
engulfing candle right in this zone
perfect counter trend trading
opportunity in a resistance zone
with indicator conditions supporting
this setup and since its price action
pattern printed
we have seen a pretty nice sell-off from
this zone which would have provided for
a really nice one-to-one target winner
so far
out of this setup so this is a 180r stop
loss
above this swing high so the way i would
have traded this is when this bar closed
i would have entered at the market
on the next bar with a 180 stop loss
above this swing high
and a one-to-one profit target on my
first position
had i been able to take advantage of
this trade i'd still be in it now and
i'd be trailing my stop-loss below price
action
as we sell off but anyway that's just an
example of how you can take advantage of
this technical analysis approach
i have an indicator i wrote in pine
script that detects
price action patterns within these zones
i just have to specify what price zone
i'm looking
at as a resistance zone and it will
alert me whenever a trading setup like a
bearish engulfing candle occurs within
that zone
so i really have no excuse for missing
this i should have set that indicator up
if you want to play around with that
just come up to the indicators section
and type in
s and r zone uh snr zone signals this is
my script i wrote that detects these
price action patterns within these zones
if i'd set this up so that my resistance
was
0.906 to 0.901
and i hit ok you can see that it's
detected
short trading opportunities here and
this script will also generate alerts
to let me know that i need to come and
place my trade but of course i didn't
have this set up
because i'm a fool and i missed out on
making a little bit of easy money here
and anyway this script is open source so
if you're interested in pine script
learning pine script
you can get the source code to this to
play around with
but i digress let's move on i'm trying
to keep this video as short as
humanly possible we have new zealand
dollar here
there's nothing to say about this chart
we're in consolidation
i'm expecting this market to move higher
because we are above this 50-day moving
average the bullish trend is still
intact
until we break and close below this low
in here this structure support level
is acting as support we've had a nice
test here that pushed the market higher
but because we are going sideways for so
long here
there's just no way i can trade this
market at the moment so i'm sitting on
my hands on new zealand dollar
let's move on to gold gold is now
bearish according to my analysis
we've had this huge sell-off from this
structure resistance zone up here
we've had this one two three move uh
lower high
lower low i'm now expecting this market
to continue even lower
to re-test these lows down here how you
could take advantage of that is on a
four-hour time frame
looking for bearish trend continuation
trades and we're having one set up right
now
if this closes as a bearish engulfing
candle within
the next hour this could be a nice
trading opportunity one atr stop-loss
above this swing high
and you're looking to capture this trend
continuation move to the downside
if it occurs and i'd say it's likely to
occur at this point
because this 50-day ema is acting as
resistance and we've had this breaking
close
below the previous swing low so gold is
bearish now according to my analysis
this green bar was an inside bar the
high and low is contained within this
big bearish bar
that's indicating momentum is still to
the downside so
certainly not looking for long trades on
this market and that's the power of
waiting for
price action confirmation within these
zones you don't buy this market just
because it's in this zone
you wait for a reason to buy it so we
dropped down a four hour chart
there was no price action pattern in
this zone at all uh to indicate that
there's a buying opportunity here
all of these bars within this closed
bearish there was no
sign of buying and so i never entered
this market long
from this zone but with that being said
now that we've closed below this zone
there's a good chance this could act as
resistance so i can now color this zone
red
drop out to the daily chart let's
identify the next level that it's likely
to stop at if we do sell off if we zoom
right out here
and look all the way back to 2011 2012
we have this
structure resistance level in here and
so
there is a potential that this swing low
in here could
act as support we did see a lot of
buying out of this zone
last time price got down here so i am
paying attention to this zone
going forward if price action can get
back down here this could be a nice
counter trend buying zone
and on this four hour time frame uh we
do have quite a lot of room to move down
here so if we do get a short trading
opportunity
up in this structure zone 11 pip atr
at the moment would put my stop-loss at
17.8 around there
one-to-one target would be before these
swing lows that's always nice
and we've got room to continue all the
way down to a
to one risk reward if we get a short
trading opportunity right around where
price action is now
if we continue a little bit higher we
get an even nicer risk reward profile
so even though these zones are pretty
close together there's still some nice
meat on this move here
if we get the appropriate price action
patterns
to enter short on according to my rules
that would be a bearish engulfing candle
while we are under this 50 ema so that's
what i'm looking for
on gold bearish on gold in the week or
two to come let's move on to the next
market which is the s p
500 now this is back in the blue sky
territory
we did find support on this 50 ema i was
talking last week about how this 50 ema
could potentially act as support
i actually didn't think that we would
given the four hour time frame
closed below this 50 day ema we had this
really heavy selling and pretty intense
volatility
i thought we'd see a little bit more of
a sell-off but we didn't because the
government
and hedge fund guys keep buying this
thing up because everyone's terrified
of the stock market reflecting reality
and so every time it sells off the big
guys step in to buy it
so that was probably an oversight on my
part i should have expected this
buying to happen but i'm flat on the s p
500 at the moment
waiting on a trend continuation
opportunity so
right now ideally that would be a
pullback back into these highs
and a nice price action pattern on a
four hour time frame
or a one hour time frame to capture this
trend continuation
so bullish on the s p 500 in the weeks
to come as for resistance
we're in new highs where the highest
we've ever been and so i have no idea
where resistance could be there's
techniques you can use to approximate or
predict
where it could go such as fibonacci
extensions
but i don't use fibonacci extensions in
my analysis
not directly sometimes i'll use them
just to see if they're in confluence
with
structure potential structure levels
psychological numbers that sort of thing
but on the s p 500 the way i'd approach
this right now is if i do get a buying
opportunity in this zone
i'm just going to trail my stop-loss
below swing lows on that four-hour time
frame
and whenever price action rolls over and
stops me out that's my exit point
so s p 500 when it's in new highs like
this the best approach
is trend following approaches don't try
and guess where the market will roll
over from
just let the market take you out when it
decides it's
had enough so that's it not much more to
say about s p
500 except that it's going up and up and
up so it would be a good idea to be
looking for buying opportunities and not
selling opportunities
or shorting opportunities then the final
two markets i want to quickly look at
novavax i've taken profit
on this trade i have sold my position up
at these highs
made a nice six to one risk reward
out of this trade which equates to about
14 or 15 percent
for me because i had two targets on here
the first one was
a two to one target up at these previous
highs second target was at this
618 extension and this structure
resistance zone looking left
so we've been testing this zone for a
couple days now
even if we break out of this zone my
position size on this market
isn't large enough for me to really care
about an extra 10
20 and so i've just liquidated my
position up here for a nice
big win and if we break through this
level
and we come back down to test it and i
get some nice structure zones
some structure price action to reference
my stop-loss against then i may re-enter
this market
uh if you're not aware novovax is a
vaccine company that creates covert
vaccines
their test results have come out pretty
promising and the australian government
has
contracted them to issue several million
vaccines to the australian populace i
bought these guys back when they were
testing this 50-day moving average
had a nice tight stop-loss because that
was my thesis this moving average was
going to hold
it did end up holding and we saw this
massive gap up on uh pre-market trading
two days in a row big gaps up and then
we're sort of topping out here
i think momentum is drying up on this
market it's going to take some more big
announcements and good news to push this
market through this resistance zone if
we go to the weekly chart
you can see that this zone was a major
resistance zone looking
left so i don't foresee us getting past
300 anytime soon
and so i'm happy to get out of my trade
here for a nice profit
and start looking at other trading
opportunities so i'm going to delete
this off my watch list now
and i don't think we'll be seeing it
coming back anytime soon if ever
this was a unique trading opportunity of
combined fundamentals with technicals
this is a rare trade i don't often take
trades like this but when i do
they can often be very nice big winners
so i'm pretty happy with how this panned
out
and i'm happy to get out of this
position so just another example of the
power of technical analysis
especially when you combine it with a
fundamental catalyst now finally the
last market on my list is the
aussie 200 this is the australian stock
market index
i bought some of this today on my
personal
sort of savings account bought into the
a200
index fund i was waiting for a nice
close out of this zone
and we got a couple of closes out of
this zone so i'm expecting this to move
higher
in the months to come and so i feel
comfortable buying
this breakout even though there's not a
lot of momentum behind it but it is a
clear breakout of these previous swing
highs
and this sort of consolidation zone and
resistance zone here
i'm expecting this market to continue
higher i'm bullish on the
aussie stock market index in the weeks
to come and so yeah i thought it was
time to add to my
aussie index holdings so that's pretty
much all my trading decisions over the
past week
they're the markets i've been following
the trading decisions i've been making
what i'm looking for going forward and i
hope you found that interesting and
educational towards your own trading
process let's wrap this video up with
the economic calendar
and that was a quick one there's nothing
on this week a couple of guys speaking
who cares probably not going to say
anything interesting so it's going to be
probably quite
weak in the market markets going to be
mostly driven by technicals and i guess
whatever news comes out regarding covert
and the vaccine
progress so that's it for this week's
market analysis
thanks for sticking around to the end if
you did you're a legend i appreciate
your time
and your interest in what i'm up to my
approach to things please leave any
feedback or suggestions
in the comments section and i'll see you
in the next video good luck with your
trading take care everyone
thanks for watching
