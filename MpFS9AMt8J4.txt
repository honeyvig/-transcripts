1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,040
okay so hello there and welcome to this

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,960
tutorial in this tutorial i'll be

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,400
talking about something that i really

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,960
didn't find online yet and i don't think

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,280
there's any documentation for it

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
i'm going to be telling you how to run

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,280
your watch kit apps on a real apple

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,320
watch now usually if you were to run

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,240
your apple watch apps

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,160
on the real apple watch you would get an

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,000
error that would say that your

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,240
application could not be verified

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
however when watching this while

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,840
watching this tutorial you'll learn

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,800
exactly how to register your apple watch

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,239
with your developer account in order to

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,920
actually have it

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,760
run your apps

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,719
so let's get started

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,480
okay so now that we're at the mac let's

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,879
see how it actually works

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,440
so now we want to find the ud id of the

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,879
apple watch and connect it to our

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,039
developer account so let's do it

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
to find the udid you go to xcode and

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
number one you have to make sure

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
just completely make sure that your

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
apple watch and your iphone are both

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,760
paired together

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
if they're not paired together

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,960
this won't work

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,320
okay so let's go back to the mac now

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,960
so first of all what i'm going to do is

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,880
i'm going to put my cursor up and it'll

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
show this little menu

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,280
so i want to click on the window button

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,320
here

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,720
and then i will just go down

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
and click on devices

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,759
it'll open up another window where if

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,720
you click on your actual iphone while

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,439
it's plugged in

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,040
then it'll tell you the device

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
information for your iphone

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
for your apple watch and all the

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
installed apps on your iphone

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,119
so we want the udid for our paired watch

48
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
so as you can see under device

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
information we have paired watch

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
information and under paired watch

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,479
information

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,680
we have identifier last

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,399
so this identifier is a ud id that we

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,040
have to copy in to our developer account

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
just like we would any other iphone ipod

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
or ipad

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,000
so now we go command c to copy this

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
and then we go here

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,520
uh and then we just want to go to your

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,840
apple developer account

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,959
go to the ios developer uh or no you

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,560
need to go to the certificates

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,720
identifiers and profiles page

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,480
and so now we can click on the devices

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,599
button

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,360
and now it's just like any other apple

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
device you just click the plus button

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
you give it a name and i'll say apple

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,879
watch

70
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,440
and you just paste in your ud id and you

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,519
click continue

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,080
that's really all you need to do here

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,440
i'm just going to put an underscore

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,560
since i already have it registered

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
so as you can see i'm going to register

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
and it doesn't let me since i already

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,599
have this register but that's basically

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,720
how you would actually connect the udid

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
now that we've connected our udid to our

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,000
developer account what we can do

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,040
is we can go back to our device

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,239
and over here you want to select the

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,440
target

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
uh whatever your app's name is watch kid

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
app

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,720
select it

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,280
and then ask it to run on your iphone

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,879
not your watch

89
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
then turn on your watch

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,959
exit the clock

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,879
and run the app i'm just going to make

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,920
sure this doesn't sleep

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,400
and you can run it by doing command r

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,519
and as you can see in just a second here

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,400
uh the app called guessing game will

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,640
actually run on the apple watch

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,599
so as you can see here

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,480
sorry

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,360
um it's uh opening up the app uh xcode

100
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
is opening the app

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
and in just a second here

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
once it's done loading

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,000
as you can see it runs the app on the

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,120
watch

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,959
so it didn't give us an error

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,799
application verification failed it

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,640
doesn't give us any errors

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,319
so that's basically how you do it

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
okay so just one last thing before we

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,799
end let's actually run the app so you

111
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,720
know how it works

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,639
so as you can see i have the app here

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,320
and i've already made a tutorial for

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
this on my youtube channel

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
so um

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
yeah i'll put a link to that in the

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
description

118
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,440
but just for now let me explain

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,160
basically this guessing game app allows

120
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,240
you to enter numbers

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,639
and the computer will tell you if the

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
number is right or wrong

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,479
you'll get unlimited tries but it counts

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,720
how many tries you've done

125
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,639
look if you enter a number too big the

126
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,759
computer will tell you that your

127
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
number's too big if you enter a number

128
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
too small the computer will tell you

129
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
that your number is too small

130
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,880
so as you can see here i'm just going to

131
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,560
click on the new number button so it

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
generates a new random number in memory

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
i can do that as many times as i want if

134
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
i want to restart the game

135
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,759
and then let's just say my guess is six

136
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
as you can see i'm clicking bigger six

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
times so you can see six is in this

138
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,960
label that means that my guess is six

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,039
but wait how do i tell the computer that

140
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,560
my guess is six

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
you click the submit button

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,400
and the watch knows that you've clicked

143
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
it and as you can see i got lucky here

144
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840
and 6 was actually the random number

145
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,919
so let's just click new number again

146
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,520
and let's just say

147
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,360
7 is my my choice

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
this is too small and if i haven't said

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
this already

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
this app will generate a random number

151
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,759
from 1 to 30. so if seven is too small

152
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,479
that means the number is in is between 7

153
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,680
and 30.

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
so as you can see i can go up maybe my

155
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
next number is 11.

156
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
eleven is too big that means it's in

157
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
between seven and eleven

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
so i can go a little bit smaller if i

159
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
want to

160
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,320
submit and i got i got it right correct

161
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,560
it three tries as you can see it says

162
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
nine correct in three tries so then

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
basically i can keep on doing that and

164
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
now you have proof that this app

165
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
actually works on the watch

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
