hello everyone
welcome to simply learn
in this session we will be discussing
about what is no code development the
applications used in the present world
are playing a massive role and having
more impact in the development but when
we talk about the development of those
applications the software part comes
into the picture the software
development uses software developers or
programmers to double up the
applications but now gone are the days
when you needed a programmer to develop
a software
technology has evolved with time and
made the meticulous job of software
development look like a child's play
even a non-technical developer or a
developer with least programming
experience can develop a really powerful
application these days
so this is our key topic for today's
discussion and the platform is popularly
known as the no code development
so without further ado let's take a look
at the agenda for today's discussion
we shall begin with learning what
exactly is no good development followed
by that the briefing of no code
development then we shall understand its
real-time implementation after that we
shall focus on top no code development
platforms and their major rules
and then we will discuss the top
companies hiring no good experts later
we will learn the major advantages and
disadvantages of no good development
finally we will wind up this session by
discussing the future of no good
development

topic
what is no code development
everyone has an idea about coding that

effort which keeps in reducing the
burden of the developers
it is easy for developers to build
applications using no good development
making changes for the application using
no code development is easy and done in
less amount of time
while building the application using
local development tools it requires more
developers in development team but using
no code development it requires only a
less number of developers compared to
the other fundamental or
traditional methods

using no good development there are many
advantages as well as some disadvantages
let's have a look at the disadvantages
now
applications developed using notepad
development platforms will have some
issues in sorting data
no code development is poorly scalable
and offers limited possibilities to
integrate into private cloud
the application built using local
development will have some issues while
functioning the application
the no good development offers limited
options and possibilities while building
the application
this is all about the advantages and
disadvantages now let us have a look at
the future of the local development
currently the no good development
technology has become a solution for
many organizations and companies in
