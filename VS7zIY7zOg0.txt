1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,159
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,080
tutorial my name is tanmay bakshi and

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,480
today

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,680
we're going to be taking a look at how

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,680
you can modify the python interpreter to

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,760
add your own custom functionality

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,200
this is a really interesting topic and

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,960
before i get into it i do want to start

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,240
off by saying that if you enjoy this

20
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,880
below

21
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
and i'd love to get in touch now diving

22
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,239
right into this first of all

23
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,079
why would you want to modify the python

24
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,280
interpreter well

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
i got into this when a couple of weeks

26
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
ago one of my friends reached out to me

27
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
they were working on an assignment and

28
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,120
as part of this assignment they wanted

29
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,200
to look at the performance of allocating

30
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,399
lists or arrays

31
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
within python and i thought well

32
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
wouldn't it be interesting to not only

33
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,480
take a look at the performance of lists

34
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,640
but also see what's happening internally

35
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,160
under the hood within the interpreter

36
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
whenever you want to

37
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,920
say append something to a list and so i

38
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
did and this led me to this whole

39
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,280
journey of modifying the python

40
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,960
interpreter to get it to do

41
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,240
what i want it to do now before i get

42
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,840
deeper into that though

43
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
i want to start off by explaining a

44
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
little bit more about how lists

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
work in programming languages in general

46
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,560
and then we'll get to modifying the

47
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,840
python interpreter

48
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
if you already know how how this works

49
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,680
you can skip over to the next chapter of

50
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,320
the video

51
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
where i actually explain how to modify

52
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
the python interpreter but first let me

53
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,759
explain how lists and sort of resizable

54
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
arrays work in general now let's just

55
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
say you're working with the c

56
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
programming language of course let's

57
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,159
just say you want to store a collection

58
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,960
of numbers

59
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,400
what you would usually do is you would

60
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
say run a malloc for a certain number of

61
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,280
integers

62
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
and your operating system your kernel

63
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
rather would give you a memory buffer

64
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
and within this memory buffer you're now

65
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,439
free

66
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,560
to store whatever data you want but

67
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
here's the thing

68
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,159
this memory buffer is technically not a

69
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,560
resizable array in the way that we think

70
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,840
of it in higher level programming

71
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
languages like javascript or python or

72
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,560
swift

73
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,520
it's a constant sized memory buffer so

74
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,200
you can't just append things to it

75
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
willy-nilly you have to use the contents

76
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
of the memory buffer that you were given

77
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,360
so

78
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,879
let's just say you start off having a

79
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,879
collection of just a single number

80
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,720
but now you want to add a second number

81
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,560
how do you do that exactly

82
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
well your kernel more than likely also

83
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
supports another operation

84
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,200
called a real lock what a real lock does

85
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,959
is it takes your original memory buffer

86
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,800
that you've already mallocked

87
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
and it effectively helps you increase

88
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,080
the size of that memory buffer

89
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,680
now internally within your kernel there

90
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
are two things that can happen

91
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
either a your kernel says this memory

92
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
buffer is already large enough so i'll

93
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
just say all right you can use one extra

94
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,599
space within it

95
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,920
or let's just say beside your memory

96
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,599
buffer there's a different buffer that's

97
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,599
being used either by a different program

98
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,239
or by

99
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,560
your own program somewhere else then

100
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
what the operating system will do is

101
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
it'll allocate an entirely new buffer

102
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
copy over your contents and then free

103
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,440
the existing one

104
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,599
and then it'll return to you that new

105
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,440
buffer effectively no matter what

106
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
happens under the hood

107
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,200
you now have a new memory buffer with

108
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,239
this new size

109
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,080
that you can use so now you can insert

110
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
your second element and you can keep

111
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,120
doing this every time you want to append

112
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,319
something you can run another you can

113
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,200
run another

114
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
reallocation request in a lot of the

115
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
cases these reallocation requests are

116
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
really really cheap

117
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
because you just want to add like say

118
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,680
one more set of four bytes

119
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
and therefore the operating system can

120
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
mostly just extend the size your memory

121
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,480
buffer

122
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
but there are some cases where it can't

123
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
do that and it's forced to allocate a

124
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,879
new buffer and copy over your contents

125
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,440
that is slow it's a very expensive

126
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,400
operation

127
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,319
so as a programmer you want to minimize

128
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,760
the number of allocations and

129
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,599
reallocations that you do

130
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,040
especially because then you've got a

131
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,599
copy over the memory buffer

132
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,840
now how do you do this exactly well one

133
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
of the most effective ways of

134
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,599
implementing resizable arrays like this

135
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,840
is by effectively increasing the amount

136
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,920
of capacity you reallocate every single

137
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,599
time so maybe you start off

138
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,480
with a capacity for a single element but

139
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,879
then

140
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,280
the next time you try to append you

141
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,640
actually now have capacity for

142
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
two elements again that's normal you've

143
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
added one extra

144
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,879
element to your buffer but now when you

145
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,000
try to append a third

146
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
you don't just allocate three spaces you

147
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
allocate four spaces total

148
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,879
so you double the size of your memory

149
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,199
buffer then when you're at four you're

150
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,560
trying to append a fifth

151
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,400
you don't just add a fifth you go to

152
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,840
eight again you

153
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,199
double the capacity of your memory

154
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,400
buffer even if you're only just

155
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
inserting a fifth

156
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,120
what that means is that your sixth

157
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
seventh and eighth insert operations are

158
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
now completely free they're 01 cost

159
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
right it's it's literally just the speed

160
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,400
of how quickly you can insert something

161
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,520
into a particular spot in ram and if you

162
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,800
just keep doing this

163
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
then you will effectively have amortized

164
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,320
01 cost

165
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,720
for appending to an array that is how

166
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
resizable arrays work in these

167
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,280
programming languages

168
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,000
and effectively what i wanted to do was

169
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,560
track

170
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
within python how many sort of

171
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,960
how many individual elements it actually

172
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
allocates in advance when you try to

173
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
append something new

174
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,479
to a list and then figure out if we can

175
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,400
actually spot where the reallocations

176
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,919
happen in a timing graph

177
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,360
based off of spikes in the amount of

178
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
time it takes to append

179
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,120
a certain value to a list and well it

180
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,000
turns out

181
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
you can do that and so i went ahead and

182
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,759
modified the python interpreter to add

183
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
that functionality that i required and

184
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
now let's get a little bit deeper into

185
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
how i did that now python is special

186
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,880
it's an interpreted programming language

187
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
that means it's not compiled

188
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
that actually makes our work quite a lot

189
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,600
easier in this case

190
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
because if python were like swift or c

191
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
for example then i would need to modify

192
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,520
the underlying assembly code that they

193
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,919
generate however in python's case it's

194
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,919
never generating any assembly code for

195
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,720
your code

196
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
all it's doing is it's a program looking

197
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
through the code you've written

198
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
and executing it quite literally

199
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,199
practically line by line

200
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,960
it's a bit more complex than that it can

201
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,039
do some level of just-in-time byte code

202
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,639
compilation but you really don't need to

203
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,600
worry about that as

204
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
it's very rarely actually used uh

205
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400
now getting into how this python

206
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
interpreter works let's just say you

207
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,039
were to create a new list within the

208
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,240
python language

209
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
well what happens is internally what the

210
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,240
interpreter's done is it's created a

211
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
backing structure within the c language

212
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,160
and that structure contains information

213
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,840
like for example the capacity of this

214
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,800
list

215
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
how many things are actually within the

216
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
list how much capacity you're using

217
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
as well as the actual pointer to the

218
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,199
memory buffer that is backing the list

219
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,720
in and of itself

220
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
now that structure you don't have access

221
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,560
to within python because you don't

222
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
exactly have raw access to c structures

223
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,919
in general in python

224
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,199
when you access the list you're

225
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,199
accessing a python class

226
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,360
that is internally backed by that

227
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,479
structure within the interpreter itself

228
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,479
and so whenever you append something to

229
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,680
a list you're really

230
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,759
you know through the call stack calling

231
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,280
a c function that's that's

232
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
working on appending uh to the buffer

233
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,919
within that list's internal structure

234
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,639
so here's my idea within that append

235
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,440
function

236
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,599
there is a call to another function that

237
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,919
is responsible for resizing the list

238
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,800
should that become necessary so if i

239
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
were to modify the resizing function

240
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,080
to somehow set some kind of flag of some

241
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,160
sort within the actual structure

242
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,479
whenever a resize is done then there's a

243
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,560
way that i could potentially detect

244
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,039
that flag from within my python code and

245
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,759
i would know

246
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,800
when the list has been resized how did i

247
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
do this exactly well first of all

248
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
i took a look at where the actual list

249
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
structure within c was located i found

250
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
that within a header file and you can

251
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
see that

252
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
now then i added an extra variable to

253
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,080
the structure for python's list

254
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
structure

255
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,160
and i call this variable was resized

256
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
it's an integer but i really treat it as

257
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,440
a boolean value

258
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,160
its value is either going to be 0 or 1 0

259
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,000
if the list was never resized or 1 if

260
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
the last append operation caused or

261
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
resize internally

262
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,759
then what i go ahead and do is modify

263
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,080
the code where python creates a new list

264
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
to initialize that variable to zero in

265
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,599
the beginning when someone creates a new

266
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,160
list

267
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
this is important because it previously

268
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,440
may be filled with garbage memory

269
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,039
from whoever was using the memory buffer

270
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,680
before malloc decided to give it to us

271
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,000
then within the resize operation if we

272
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
do go ahead and call reallock

273
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
i then set the was resized flag of the

274
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
python list object structure

275
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,800
to 1. this can tell me within my python

276
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
code that the list was resized

277
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
now i can go ahead and recompile the

278
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,599
python interpreter and that's right you

279
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,080
just

280
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
recompiled it from scratch you've

281
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
created your own build of python which

282
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,639
is pretty incredible

283
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,479
and i can go ahead and run it now a

284
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,840
couple of things to note

285
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,479
first of all the python programming

286
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,280
language

287
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
isn't actually what you run on your

288
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
computer python is a programming

289
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,959
language is only a specification

290
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,039
more than likely when you run python in

291
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
your terminal you're running what's

292
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,039
known as c

293
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,479
python which is a specific

294
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,880
implementation of the python programming

295
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,560
language specification

296
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,839
c python is what we're actually

297
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,600
modifying today it's entirely open

298
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,640
source

299
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
but once again here's the thing i just

300
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,399
added a flag to the list object

301
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,519
structure

302
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,040
but i don't have access to that

303
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,519
structure within python so what do i do

304
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,279
well what i decided to do was actually

305
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,040
write another bit of c code

306
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
this other bit of c code had knowledge

307
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,480
of what the python's list object

308
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
structure is because i imported that

309
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,800
header

310
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
and what i did was i basically created a

311
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
very simple function all this function

312
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
does is it takes the pointer to the

313
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
internal list object structure

314
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
and it returns to me the value of the

315
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
was resized flag

316
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,959
meaning i don't need to try and access

317
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,800
that flag directly from python because

318
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,440
now

319
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,000
i can just call this c code from python

320
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,399
to access the structure for me

321
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,959
and here's what's really convenient if

322
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,880
the was resized flag was already set to

323
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,200
one

324
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,360
it will return one to me but first it

325
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
will reset the flag to zero

326
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
meaning that if in the future another

327
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
append operation does a resize

328
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
the flag has been reset and i can detect

329
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,680
that in the future as well

330
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
then i put together a very simple python

331
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
script all it does is it puts together a

332
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,920
list

333
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
and continuously pens a bunch of

334
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
elements to it and every single time a

335
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
resize operation is detected

336
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,959
through my c code it goes ahead and

337
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,160
resets a counter

338
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
and it creates effectively a list of how

339
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
many elements were elapsed

340
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,800
between resize operations now let's go

341
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
ahead and run this code and see if it

342
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,800
works

343
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,600
and as you can see the python script

344
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,959
goes ahead and prints out

345
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,760
the number of elements elapsed between

346
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
individual resize elements

347
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,839
resize operations and as you can see

348
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,800
over time

349
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,519
it takes more and more append operations

350
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
in order to trigger a resize

351
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
that is why the append operation can

352
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,279
effectively be thought of

353
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,760
as having 01 cost because it amortizes

354
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,279
over time it averages out

355
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,079
to effectively having 01 cost you don't

356
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,880
need to worry

357
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,000
about those few times it's doing resizes

358
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,680
and that is how you can modify the

359
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
python interpreter to add your own

360
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
custom functionality i do hope you

361
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
enjoyed this tutorial but then again

362
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,079
this is just the tip of the iceberg

363
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,079
there is so much more you can do

364
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,920
by modifying the internals of these

365
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
programming languages

366
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,800
to do some really interesting stuff as a

367
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,079
matter of fact if you want to see me

368
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,839
modify a specific language to do a

369
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,640
specific thing

370
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
please do feel free to leave that

371
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
request down in the comments section

372
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,640
below

373
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
i'd absolutely love to take a look at it

374
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
and potentially create another youtube

375
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
video on modifying some more programming

376
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,040
languages

377
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,320
once again i do hope you enjoyed that

378
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,760
