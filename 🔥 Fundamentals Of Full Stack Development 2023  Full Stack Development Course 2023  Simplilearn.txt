updates from Simply learn so let's go
through the agenda for today's video
we'll start this video with what is
fullstack web development then we'll
cover how to become a fullstack web
developer and which programming language
you should learn first to enter in this
field we'll also take you through the
basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript these
three languages are vital to entering
the field of web development following
that we'll go through backend web
development and the difference between a
front-end developer and a backend
developer towards the end we'll take you
through the concept of no code code
development and some tips to improve
logic in programming and finally we'll
take you through both front-end and
backend interview questions to help you
master the field of fullstack web
development so if you also want to
become a successful software developer
and gain handsome salary packages then
look at the wide range of software
development courses by simply learn in
collaboration with the top universities
across the globe by enrolling in any of
these certification programs you will
Master modern coding techniques with
boot camp level intensity becoming a
fullstack technologist this program lays
the foundation for crafting fullstack
web applications so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll now a year of
experience is preferred to enroll in
these courses so check out the link
mentioned in the description box below
for more details so without any further
delay let's hand over this session to
our training experts hey everyone I'm
sure you're all aware that every
application that you use today has
something called the front end which is
the the user interface and the back end
which is the software that accesses data
for us and finally we have the database
to store the data now these three
together form something called as the
full stack so hi guys welcome to this
video on what is full stack by simply LA
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so
here's what's in store for you first
we'll have a look at what frontend
development is then we'll see some of
the front end
languages then we'll move on to some
front end libraries and
Frameworks then we'll see what backend
development is understand some of the
popularly used backend languages in
Frameworks and finally we'll have a look
at the database so now what exactly is
front end every time you open a website
it has several UI components and once
you click on a particular icon say sign
in in this case is you get navigated to
the signin or the login page right so
what happens is that all of these items
facilitate navigation and
utility these are collectively called as
the front end so the front end is the
visible part of the website or the web
application which is responsible for
user experience the user directly
interacts with the front- end portion of
the website or the web
application so now let's have a look at
some of the front-end languages
so I'm sure you've heard of HTML CSS and
JavaScript so these are collectively
called the front-end languages when it
comes to HTML it defines the structure
of websites and formats the web pages it
also defines text documentation so let's
look at a simple example if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
skillup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
here I've made use of the H1 tag which
is the heading tag in HTML and I've
displayed the message hello welcome so
correspondingly my website displays the
same message so HTML is responsible or
it defines what is being shown on the
website next up is CSS now CSS is a
stylesheet that allows you to alter and
style different web components beat size
font spacing Etc it makes the content on
the website look more decorative correct
so now if you have a look at the code
here I've added some styling I've
changed the font style to italic I've
made the text bold and I've changed the
color to red and again correspondingly
all the changes are seen on the
website moving on we have JavaScript now
JavaScript is a very powerful client
size scripting language and it is mainly
used for enhancing the interaction of a
user with the web page so again if you
have a look at the code here I've
created a form wherein the user can
enter their name and I've also displayed
the message please enter your name as a
result an input box is made available
where the user can type in their name
now this is facilitated by JavaScript so
as I mentioned earlier it is used to
make web pages interactive and bring the
web applications to life so next let's
have a look at some front end Frameworks
and libraries now most of these are
JavaScript Frameworks and libraries
first we have react then there's angle
there's view there's jQuery and then
there's bootstrap now all of these help
develop the front end of the application
however when it comes to react angular
in view it's not necessary that you must
know everything to create a website one
of them will be sufficient however the
usage of react is on the rise and most
of the developers prefer using react
jQuery and bootstrap are also powerful
Frameworks that can be used to create
interactive web pages now that you know
what front-end development is you must
be wondering how the data is being
fetched and how this data is being
presented in front of you on your screen
correct now this is all facilitated by
the back end of the application so let's
understand what backend development
is now back end basically refers to the
server side development of the
application it is responsible for
managing all the database with the help
of queries and apis so every time user
makes a request it queries the database
and retrieves the data from the database
and presents it to the user and lastly
it ensures data
consistency so now let's have a look at
some backend languages and
Frameworks firstly we have node node and
expressjs are packages provided by
JavaScript then there's python which is
a very popularly used language python
Frameworks like Jango and flask are
popularly used to create the backend of
applications then there's Java and Java
provides spring and Java server faces
which are also used for backend
development then there's cop which
provides Frameworks like asp.net core
and asp.net MVC and other popularly used
backend languages are PHP that's Pearl
and Ruby database is the collection of
interrelated data which helps in
efficient retrieval insertion and
deletion of data from database and
organizes the data in the form of tables
views schemas reports now some of the
commonly used database Management
systems are MySQL there's postra SQL
there's Microsoft SQL Server there's
Oracle database and then there's mongodb
but how can we at simply learn help you
if you wish to make a career as a full
stack developer then a certification
will come in handy for that you could
head to our official website and look
for full stack development courses now
we offer the fullstack Java developer
Masters
program we also provide the postgraduate
program in fullstack web development and
we also provide the fullstack web
developer meanstack Masters program you
can go ahead and click on the program
and have a look at the overview if this
suits your requirements you can go ahead
and purchase the course so for the ones
whove joined in now today's topic of
discussion is how to become a full stack
developer so let's begin
so here are the topics that we're going
to be discussing so first we'll see what
fullstack development is who is a
fullstack developer then we'll move on
to the responsibilities and then we'll
dive into the detailed road map and then
it also let you know about the salades
of fullstack developers and finally how
you can get
certifications all right now what
exactly is fullstack development now
consider a web application let's say
instag stagram so every time you refresh
the page new images are
loaded so this is what the user
experiences right new images are loaded
onto his feed but what exactly happens
behind the scenes is that the back end
fetches new images from the Instagram
servers and these images are then loaded
onto your Instagram feed right the app
is so easy to use and leaves the users
extremely
satisfied in case of any application
there's always the front end the back
end and the database so the process of
building all of these aspects for an
application is called Full stack
development so I hope you understood
what exactly fullstack development
is so moving on let's see who a
fullstack developer
is now basically a fullstack developer
works with both front end and the back
end of an
application he has to be familiar with
languages like HTML CSS JavaScript and
also one or more backend Frameworks like
node.js and
python now these developers have got all
the web development skills to build
websites and applications from start to
finish now that we've understood what
exactly a fullsack developer does let's
look at some of his
responsibilities now the first
responsibility is developing the front
end so as discussed they must be able to
develop the user interface for the users
with the help of HTML and
CSS next up is design the backend now
this is also the most crucial part of
app development they should be able to
design robust backend architecture to
ensure the smooth functioning of
fetching and
updation next up is to design database
and servers now databases and servers
must be resilient to any outages and
must maintain consistency
next up is crossplatform
compatibility now depending on the
platforms there could be some
discrepancy and alteration in the
functioning of an application right it's
crucial to make sure that the
applications pay accordingly on all
these
platforms next up is developing apis
depending on the pl architecture the
developer must be able to develop
apis the application must also be
responsive and interactive and keep the
user completely
engaged and lastly it should meet all
the technical and consumer
requirements so these were the few
responsibilities of a fullstack
developer moving on let me explain to
you a simple road map of how to go about
to become a fullstack
developer so this road map basically
shows you the prerequisites and skills
one should have to become a success
successful F stle
Lop all right so let's go ahead and
begin with tools and software now the
first and the most rudimentary
requirement is a text editor now the
most widely used editor is vs code it is
free open source and can be used to code
in different platforms like Windows Mac
OS and
Linux next up is a web browser so you
can either use Firefox or Chrome but
Chrome is highly
preferred
now also you could need a few edited
extensions and vs code has a few of them
some of them could be life SAS compiler
and live
server moving on you need to have a good
hold on HTML and CSS so HTML is a markup
language that is used to define the
content that appear on your web page
right the developer can incorporate
images text and videos depending on the
requirements and moving on to CSS it is
basically a St sheet which is used to
decorate your entire application it is
used to define the appearance of the
content say in terms of shape color size
spacing
Etc next up is Javascript now this is
the most widely used front-end language
and enhances the interaction with the
web page now you might want to brush up
your knowledge on simple Concepts like
arrays functions objects and loops
you can also learn es6 features like
call backs promises Ayn
await Dom manipulation and event fet API
and Json all of these are required when
you're making use of different
JavaScript Frameworks and libraries so
I'd recommend you brush up your
knowledge on all of these
topics react angular View and jQuery are
some of the JavaScript libraries and
Frameworks that one can use now all of
these topics that we discussed earlier
be it ESX Fe features or basic concepts
they come in very handy when you're
using these
Frameworks among react View and angular
over the last couple of years react has
gained immense popularity followed by
which view is also being widely used now
angular has seen a downward curve over
the past few years so depending on your
requirements you can choose one of these
Frameworks next up is Version Control
now git and GitHub are the most widely
used Version Control Systems now git
basically helps you manage project files
git basically keeps track of the entire
history of things that the user is
working on right so it makes sure that
it allows the user to backtrack and see
what he's worked on until then moving on
to GitHub it is basically a web based
service for Version Control using git
now the user can also look into other
people's code identify issues or errors
and also even propose changes now this
comes in extremely helpful when you're
working in a
team let's move ahead and look at some
of the backend environment now the most
popularly used environment is nodejs now
this is basically an open-source
crossplatform runtime environment that
allows developers to create server side
tools and applications in JavaScript now
node is typically used to create
realtime applications with two-way
connections where in both the client and
the servers can communicate and exchange
data without any hassle now I really
recommend you have a basic knowledge on
command line as well that is now
knowledge and basic command line like
npm that is note package manager is also
essential so this was a simple overview
on
nodejs moving on to other backend
languages there's Python and the most
commonly used framework that is D Jango
now python is the easiest programming
language out there and I'm sure
everybody will agree with me with with
this so it also offers many libraries
and Frameworks for different
Technologies so when it comes to backend
in fullstack development Jango is a
clear winner now it is a highlevel
python framework that enables rapid
development of websites it is also free
and open- source and has a huge active
community of users so I'd really suggest
you get your hands on Django and work on
it
extensively
moving on let me give you a brief
overview on the trends in 2020 first up
is
blockchain now blockchain is an emerging
technology and has seen tremendous
growth in the last few years now it has
also entered into domains like
healthcare and
finance next up is AI and chat BS AI is
booming and there is no doubt in that so
languages like Python and JavaScript
Frameworks like tens of floor are widely
used
mobile app development this is one of
the top trends you should look out for
in 2020 now there are mobile
applications for practically anything
these days so Frameworks like react
native and flutter can be deployed to
develop these
applications next up is Progressive web
applications now these are like a hybrid
of mobile and web apps they are faster
to load and provide some amazing
features like push notifications another
important feat feature is their ability
to work
offline lastly we have iot with the
increasing number of devices getting
connected to the internet every second
development of iot applications is also
on a
rise so these were the few trends that
you should look out for in
2020 moving ahead let's look at the
salary of fullstack
developers now according to pay scale
the average salary of a fullstack
developer in India is around 590,000
rupees per
anom the average salary of a fullstack
developer in the US is around
$75,000 per
anom all right so moving on to the fun
part let's go ahead and look at a simple
quiz now here is a quiz question which
of the following is not a JavaScript
framework or a
library option A yet option b
angular option C pandas or option D bu
so let us know your answer in the chat
section one lucky winner will get a
voucher so I'll keep this on the screen
for a
while mind you which of the following is
not a JavaScript framework or a
library so comment your answer answer
immediately all right so moving ahead
let me tell you how simply learn can
help
you now there are several online
certification courses but if you're
looking for something that is concise
and well structured then head out to the
simply learn website and here you can
see a few options you have the fullstack
Java developer Masters program you have
the fullstack developer.net Masters
program
and you also have fullstack web
developer meanstack Masters
program you can also go through the
overview and depending on your
requirement you can choose the
appropriate course be discussing which
programming language you should learn
first however before we begin with the
session let's take a look at the agenda
for today's discussion first we will
begin with learning the role of
programming then I will walk you through
our next topic to understand which
programming language you should learn
first after that we will move into
learning jobs to be expected then we
will dive deep into learning the top and
trending programming languages at
present finally we will wind up by
discussing the benefits of learning
programming before we begin with the
session make sure that you have
subscribed to our YouTube channel and
don't forget to click that Bell icon to
never miss an update from Simply Lear so
without any further Ado let's let get
started with our first topic on the
session what is the role of
programming programming language is an
artificial language used to control a
machine's Behavior particularly a
computer programming languages are used
to facilitate communication between
organizing and manipulating information
to express algorithms precisely
programmers usually code and work on the
programs to communicate easily with the
computer programming also involves
maintaining debugging troubleshooting
and many software related
issues now let's have a look at which
programming language you should learn
first the first step to learning
programming is to identify the
programming language you would want them
to
learn focus on courses that start from
the basics of programming language
because at the end Concepts should be
clear so you can grasp any language you
want to learn and gain Proficiency in
that language it is also quite easy to
understand the concepts when you move
further most of the programming
languages are related to one another
most of the concepts are always covered
in other languages as well if you are a
beginner to programming and looking
forward to learning programming then C
programming language is the best
programming language to start with C
programming language covers all the
basics which can make it easy to learn
other programming languages a general
purpose programming language supporting
structured programming lexical variable
scope and recursion with a static type
system in simple terms we can say C
programming language is a computer
programming language developed to do
system programming for the operating
system Unix and is an imperative
programming language it was initially
developed at baps by Dennis Richie
between 1992 and
1993 it was designed to provide
low-level access to memory and language
constructs that map efficiently to
machine instructions all with minimal
runtime
support let's have a look at some of the
top topics covered in C programming
language data types storage classes
input and output control statements
operators functions pointers memory
management and file handling let us have
a look at a simple program in C
programming
language here is the quote of how we can
develop a program in the SE language
this is a basic program in C language
you can see that on my screen we're
trying to print a simple message using C
programming language that is hello world
now moving ahead let's talk about some
major benefits of learning C programming
language once you have a good command
oversee programming language you might
want to go to an advanced level of
programming by learning new programming
languages and become a software
developer or in case if you're not
interested in programming and you're
good at numbers then you might want to
become a data scientist or a data
analyst and there are a wi spectrum of
jobs available in the IT industry based
on programming now let us have a look at
the jobs to be expected in the IT
industry once you're comfortable with a
programming
language there are many types of jobs to
be expected after learning programming
but let us see at the top trending jobs
in the IT industry which give a heavy
and handsome
salary the first and top one of those is
the data scientists a data scientist is
a is a professional who gathers and
analyzes large sets of data data
scientists also possess and help in
solving complex problems the skills that
a data scientist should possess are to
be good at mathematics statistics and
analytics and also some good programming
languages like python R and SQL followed
by that we have big data engineer big
data has been a revolution in every
business sector a big data developer is
responsible for storing processing and
analyzing the data they design and
develop significant data architecture
they should have some skills like hadu
Apache spark Java and SQL next we have
software developer so this kind of job
role is especially for those people who
are really interested in coding and
programming software developers majorly
analyze design and develop software to
make the ends meet they maintain the
design and Software System at times they
also oversee the work of computer techn
technologist programmers and technicians
they should have skills like
mathematical aptitude problem solving
skills programming languages excellent
organizational and time management
skills accuracy and attention to detail
next we have web developers web
developers try to develop the software
applications and integrate user facing
elements into applications they also
help and instruct the organizations with
logical Frameworks they should have some
good skills with web development and web
development programming languages like
python PHP and much more and also they
should be comfortable with web
development
Frameworks so now that we have discussed
the jobs to be expected after having
some fundamental understanding with
programming let us see how the jobs are
categorized in IT industry majorly the
jobs are categorized into two segments
software development and web development
and on the other hand we have data
science and data analytics so if you're
are a hardcore programmer then you can
choose software development and web
development if you're good with number
statistic itics and like to make
predictions using the data then data
analytics is the good job rule for you
and if you're interested in developing
machine learning algorithms and try to
interact with artificial intelligence
then data science would be the right job
rule for you now let us understand the
top trending programming languages for
either of the job roles for being a
software developer and a web developer
the major programming languages that you
need to concentrate on are python Java
and JavaScript so the major skill that
you need to require to become a software
developer or a web developer are to have
a good command over coding Proficiency
in data structures and algorithms having
a good knowledge of database software
testing JavaScript HTML and CSS SEO that
is search engine optimization and lastly
front-end and backend application
development so the major skills required
by a data scientist and a data analyst
are having good understanding of SQL
Microsoft Excel our programming language
Python program programming language
machine learning skills presentation
skills data visualization and critical
analytical thinking now let's have a
look at the top and trending programming
languages and the first one in the list
is python python is the most preferred
programming language because of the
syntax of Python programming language
can be very easy to understand for all
the readers and Python programming
language is also loaded with libraries
that help in implementing scientific
Computing working and deployment in
Python are supportive and Easy in any
environment so these are the some of the
topmost topics covered in Python which
include strings lists and tles
dictionaries and sets conditional
execution and Loops comprehensions
functions modules Scopes and name spaces
file handling writing Library object
oriented programming this is the most
important concept then we have iterator
generator decorators regular Expressions
building framework exception handling
and context manager meta classes
introspection multi-threading and multi
processing now let us also understand
some of the important reasons to Learn
Python programming language python
provides clean syntax that is easy to
understand and learn for beginners by
learning python we can expect better
jobs with high paying salaries one of
the major benefits of python is it
provides open source development these
are few reasons why to choose Python and
the next one is Java in this modern time
Java is the best language to choose
nearly thousands of applications
software and development tools are built
using Java programming language this
technology is mainly used in creating
websites such as YouTube Google Amazon
and much more some of the important
topics to be covered in Java are
objectoriented programming Concepts
basic Java constructs like loops and
data types string handling collection
framework multi-threading exception
handling generics synchronization
serialization and
deserialization concurrent collection
swing graphical user interface and
access modifiers in
Java now let us also learn some of the
important reasons to choose Java
programming language there is a lot of
demand for Java developers in the
software industry for its benefits Java
also provides open source Library
support which is a major benefit in the
development of
applications Java also offers a wide
range of development tools which help
develop the applications in a better way
these are a few reasons why to choose
Java and the next one is our programming
language our language is very scalable
and makes it easy to build aesthetic web
applications this language is mainly
developed using statistics and data
science
knowledge R acts as a crossplatform
because of the ability to run on any
operating system so some of the
important topics to be learned are how
to manage CSV files Excel files binary
files XML files Json files web data how
to connect to a database and then the
data visualization tools which include
learning how to create pie charts bar
charts Etc then how to calculate mean
median and mode linear regression
logistic regression normal distribution
binomial distribution poison regression
nonlinear least Square decision tree
random Forest Etc so all these things
come under
statistics now let us also look at some
of the important reasons to choose R
programming language R is machine
independent it supports crossplatform
operation thus it is usable on many
different operating systems R is an open
source programming language due to this
R has a huge community that contributes
to its environment R helps in
development of interactive web
applications so these are the few
reasons why to learn our programming
language and the most important and
final one is the JavaScript JavaScript
is responsible for fast and secure
development the main advantage and
perspective are to provide more
interactivity with the users and coders
it also helps in expanding Innovative
Technologies which involve animation
gaming and
rendering some of the important Concepts
to be learned in JavaScript are objects
classes functions properties methods
accessors Constructors prototypes ites
sets Maps HTML Dom asynchronous browser
object material web apis Json and jQuery
now let us understand some of the
reasons why to choose JavaScript
JavaScript is the most popular language
which is a reason for increasing the
development and speed of applications
JavaScript is easy to learn and
understand which is a major benefit for
learning JavaScript JavaScript also
provides the ability to support all
browsers which can be more beneficial to
choose
JavaScript so these are the few reasons
why to choose JavaScript finally let's
have a look at the benefits of learning
programming programming helps in
building self-confidence in a person
while dealing with projects they also
hold a critical role in career
development programming also helps in
improving creativity while dealing with
the applications and projects they use
much creativity to develop those they
require a lot of creative knowledge and
also it helps in starting your own
business programming also helps in
situations like problem solving using
these it is easy to find solutions to
complex problems perfectly and also it
helps in development of creative and
Innovative technology so in this HTML
Bas handson we are expecting that all of
you are aware about the basic concept of
HTML as well as the CSS so this kind of
learning is going to help you to
understand like how HTML and CSS can
connect together while offering you a
mini application the first application
on this track we're going to offer you
that is related to your HTML
registration page okay so as you know
for this particular registration
development application I would like to
use the visual studio code which is one
of the very very popular tool provided
by Microsoft so this tool we will be
using it for our mini application
development so let's get started with
this so step number one let me go back
and create a new folder now I'm going to
create a new folder name called
registration and inside this I would
require two files number one is called
index.html and another one that is
called C CSS we can say app. CSS so in
index.html file we want some standard
development so I want to start with my
HTML tag so I already have this HTML
based autofill code provided by your
Visual Studio code so there are plugins
are available inside this so that you
can automatically create the basic
structure for this HTML which you can
have the HTML tag head tag and as well
as the body tag and from this point
onwards we will start developing our
code now so I want to develop a

the places I will be using the container
so you see here in index.html file uh
when we talk about form actions and and
all okay we say H1 register we haven't
used any container right now so let's

that is an
opacity
well four properties has given now let's
see how it
looks yeah why because we haven't added
a CSS in my HTML so let's add a CSS so
inside my browser
HTML now inside my head me add
Link Link R style shet HF equal to app.
CSS that's set now let's
see there we go looks better now so this

great so like this you see how the
conditions are working when I press on
register you see the
messages please fill the field blank and
it
is changing the
when we talk about the situation called
Focus so in this it works like that when
I give the name you see now how the
background color is changing now welcome
back friends so just like my previous
example this time I would like to also
introduce you the another very
interesting application which is called
navigation look when we talk about HTML
based development so in HTML based
development navigation is very important
where you have a called multiple Pages
attached to so that when you click on
this page or click on any hyperlink it
will take you to the new page now so
that you can move back and forth so this
navigation is very essential part of any
web development so that you can offer
the navigation so this simple
application of HTML we would like to
start from scratch so let's go and
create a new folder now and give the
name called
navigation and inside this navigation we
want to create some new pages so here
I'm going to create
index
HTML the CSS name will be app. CSS and
along with this we would like to also
create some new folder inside this I'll
keep all the navigation files inside
this so I can say Pages inside this
Pages let me have total number of three
pages with me one is called
about
HTML then we
create contact
HTML then we create one more that is
called services.
HTML do HTML so these three links we
will create it one by one but first
let's start with the index. htl so
what's there in my index. HTML file so
first thing I would like to start with
my same HTML syntax
here well this is my basic construct so
I will start with my link Ariel from
here so that I can have my style ship
with me link Arial to style shed hfal to
app do CSS though I have not written
anything but I just left it as a blank
in my body tag I would start with uh
navigation so HTML 5 brought you some
new tags known as called a nav tag which
is once
again won't change anything drastically
in your browser however they are called
semantics which will help you for the
SEO that stand for search engine
optimization so I'll start with my nav
inside my nav I will start with my
div div I'll say navigation bar so but
before that I say class equal
to
heading there is my D tag and inside my
div tag I want to ping my heading so I
say
H4 and I
say navigation run and after the div tag
I will start with my Ur tag which is the
unordered list inside my unordered list
I can say Li that stand for list items
and I can offer lot many links inside
this so you will I just offer the class
equal
to na hyphen
links and inside this my a tag I say a
which is the anchor
tag
so a link HF equal
to now here I offer the name I say
index htl and uh that's it and this will
be by default active so we say class
equal
to
active
a class equal to active and H equal to
index.html file and here we offer
home for homepage I'll copy this
line and paste it for other three
URLs so here the active won't be there
instead we say HF equal to the location
called
Pages under this Pages we say
about about. HTML and here we say
about okay copy
this paste it and a part of this about
we always say services. HTML and here we
say
Services insert this
contact
contact okay and once the na tag is over
I will offer the
div div
plus equal to just give the name body
hyphen
text I just say H1 tag inser this and
this is the homepage
that's it so that's my homepage which is
ready with me and along with this
whichever the other pages are also
available those pages I also want to use
so first of all let me check how this
page looks like
in well it looks like a pretty basic
page so once this page is ready
what I will do is here I copy the
content and pasted it here and above and
let's see what's there in my above see
few things will change number one
here this app.
CSS now here we have to just
use
dot dot there's an app. CSS for me so
you have to offer some title too so
after this link are here
offer title this title I can
say
about okay so rest everything is fine so
H4 navigation bar n links here I have to
offer the links for my base HTML page so
so when I talk about index. htl
file okay it won't come
so index 5 so I won't say it is an
active anymore I just remove this
line plus equal to active it's just an
normal HF but about would be active in
this case so a
class equal
to active h this Services
contact is as usual same but I would not
be having any Pages
anymore because we are in the same
location that's why and here I say this
is
a about this is about
page about page so that's it I'll go
back and check it all fine home is
active right now about you can see it is
an about page right now about page is
just appear as it is saying contents are
more or less looks like and same that is
why you are able to see now just like
that I will just go back and copy the
others now here have CSS navigation
bar
active it is in contact so it make
contact as an
active so nextext HT file remain same
this
is contact
page so that's how it is and uh it will
say about my other properties which is
my services I copy
sorry copy this
contact and
here I'll be activating
my service in this case
so class equal to active I remove it
from
here make it available here this is
service page navigation index pages
about active yeah all looks good heading
about okay here I
change
service there I change
to cont so looks fine let's
see okay service contact
about
so for about we need to check where we
need to
go so we have got pages about HTML pages
also there
so all there so we would like to see how
the about page will be activated here
index.html file also contains an about
so here
when
I
refresh
well call index. HTM
page talk about called
about well this about page

for
you okay so that's how exactly my thing
is so we're all good and
uh Services contact home all good well
my page is now ready and going forward
we would like to beautify my pages by
offering the CSS well let's get started
with our CSS file so in my CSS file I
will start with my common properties

really nice so nav links are ready and
uh I want to make it a heading heading I

differentiate here awesome so this
navigation bar is now looking great and
uh it is giving me all the basic
operation whichever we have expected now
this nav links whichever we have created
okay they are working fine but I just
want to make it even more beautiful and
how I can make it more beautiful to make
it I would like to go ahead with the nav

do active when the anchor tag is active
then in that case I want to change the
background

what I see is when it is an active Okay
when it is an active I will change the
color

be active background color I want to
change it to Green so for that we just
using the color
hash
this is a green color when it is an
active and when this is not active so we
can just say a colon active which you

say a colon h
a
over a colon over and here we say colon

DOT active that's it let's see how it
works awesome this looks beautiful home
home is active right now you say it is
on a homepage now you can see it is an
about page it is service page it is a
Conta now you can see it looks even more
awesome welcome to this tutorial on drop
down menu in HTML by simply learn in
this tutorial we are going to learn how
you can create a a drop down in your na
bar using just HTM and CSS so without
further Ado let's get started so we are
on our sublim text editor I have the
HTML and CSS file ready so let's start
by adding the standard boiler
plate let's give it a
title link your CSS file to the HTML
file now inside the body I'll add the
uls we have added this hash so that when
you click on this home button it won't
redirect you to
anywhere so just save the
file
and we'll go back to our page so you can
see we have this home here okay so let's
add some
more so just copy paste
this and we'll name this section
about now inside this about I'll require
some sub menus so inside this I'll open
another UL tag
we'll add sections such as
team
CLI
career and
Legacy and we'll close the LI tag
here okay now save the file and go back
here and
refresh
now we'll add some more so
here we'll add the LI for
contact okay so inside this contact I'll
add the sub
menus so
and I'll copy this code and I'll edit it
here okay so inside the contacts I'll
need
email
phone let's say
Twitter and this will be my LinkedIn
okay now we'll add some more
sections we name the
services and this one will be my
news okay
okay so this looks fine a little bit of
alignment
yeah so you can see we have this home
about contact services and news and
inside this we have the sub
menus okay we have forgot to add here
hash inside the shs this mention
hash
everywhere
okay save the
file go back and refresh okay so you can
see we have this HTML ready now let's go
back to the CSS and design these drop
downs so first inside our
HTML select the body tag We'll add one
background image so just the background
looks more
attractive so I have one image file
saved so I jpj so
save go back and
refresh yeah you can see we have this
black thing uh we'll shrink this
image so we'll keep the background size
to
cover and we'll keep the font family to
aial yeah okay so for the UL
tag we'll keep the margin to
zero we'll keep the padding to zero as
well and we'll set the list di To
None okay now we'll design the UR Li
part so we'll keep the float to
left which will set to 200
pixels we set the height to say 40
pixels um we'll keep the background
color
to something darker say dark
blue dark gray
okay keep the opacity to
0.9 line height 40
pixels uh keep the text aligned to
Center
and font size
to 20
pixels save the file go back and
refresh okay you see we have the
background image in the place we have
this snap bar in the place and all the
drop downs are
here
okay now it's time to design
UL l n a
so for this we'll keep the text
decoration To
None color let's keep
white and we'll set the display to
block save the file and go
back now we'll add the hor effects for
this drop downs
okay so UL
lii a.
over we'll keep the background color for
the h to
[Music]
say any col you can say light
Sal save let's see how it looks on the
page
refresh yeah it's look
good now the final part of this requires
this to shrink inside just when we H
over this so the the drop downs will
appear
okay so we'll set this UL
Li
li2 display
none
and we'll add the whole effect over
Li so that when we hold the drop down
appears
save go back and refresh now you can see
all the drop downs are inside
this when hold over it and the drop
downs
appear okay so this is all about the
dropdowns menu in HTML as you saw that
we can create the beautiful drop downs
just by using the HTML and CSS nothing
fany so if you also want to become a

hurry up and enroll now a year of
experience is preferred to enroll in
these courses so check out the link
mentioned in the description box below
for more
details
so first of all what we have it today so
we'll be talking about introduction to
XML features of XML some advantages of
XML limitations of XML and the
comparison between HTML versus XML and
then we'll be having a demo now let's
get started about an
XML so we're going to start with the
introduction what is an XML see
typically we say XML stand for
extensible markup language it is a
language which we use it for machine
okay so that we can send some
instructions to our uh I would say uh
computerized developed containers or
some softwares because XML is one of the
very very easy
language which we use it but it is not
for human human in the sense like it is
not designed to uh be read by human it
is designed to be read by your computer
components so it is designed to send
store and receive to display the data so
it is actually a platform and
programming language independent that
means you talk about it as a platform
and language independent language and
where the HTML comes with predefined tag
XML doesn't have any predefined tag that
means you go and create your own tags
okay well let's quickly talk about
features of XML see as I said extensible
and human readable human readable means
it is not like an assembly language
which human cannot read it okay it is
not a machine language which human
cannot read it human can read it but it
is not a human friend
the way you see the typical languages
are there okay it preserve the white
spaces so if you give the extra spaces
so white spaces are actually preserved
here so the best part is what it is more
simple to use and
Implement okay and uh XML is all about
holding the data where the HTML is
responsible for presenting the data so
normally we
say HTML is designed for presenting what
data we are trying to offer
to display and XML is talking about what
data is okay so there are two different
ideas now undefined tags that means you
go and create your own tags here so it
is primar known for holding the data so
if you want to send some information
receive some information you put it
under the XML so it is a well structured
format so we know it XML is w3c standard
so it contains all the necessary
structured information and sub
descriptive in nature because while
seeing this you can itself you easily
make it out what is going on
inside now advantages of XML now the
first is it is a platform independent it
supports a standard uni code bits
character set and whenever you want to
transport any data while sending from
one language to another language you can
easily do that so overall I can say like
the two languages which wants to
communicate with each other like in net
and Java so neither net needs to know
about the Java nor Java needs to know
about net but they can send the data to
each other in the form of XML which both
of them know how to interpret so that is
the best part of the XML so you can see
it is a completely compatible with Java
and 100% portable in fact XML can be
also be compatible with other languages
too like in PHP and net and all okay so
as I discussed with you for the sharing
the information and uh when you want to
talk about uh the DDD called document
type definition this is the very old and
simplified version of the uh XML where
the DTD will Define the schema saying
that hey this is what the document must
be formatted in that way so when it
comes to the formatting like you talk
about the document has to have these
many field so you talk about these
things when it comes to the DTD into
this
picture now the limitations of XML
number one as I discussed with you it is
verbos and rent compared to the Json
because Json is the modern day language
which we use it compared to the XML
Which is far more easier but you cannot
avoid or you cannot ignore the presence
of XML in the current market High
storage Transportation cost for large
volume data but obvious because when you
send some information to form of XML so
certainly you require some additional
passers which needs to pass the data and
for that heavy pass it requires more
memory and more storage
so it doesn't support an array okay so
it just support the normal I would say
the string data which you want to carry
it now okay so it is file size are
usually large because due to its veros
in nature so there are some limitations
are available in
XML okay so HTML versus XML I told you
earlier HTML is all about how to display
and XML is all about what data is okay
HTML is a markup language XML is also
markup language but it is all about uh
it offers a framework to define the
markup language it is not a case
sensitive HT XML is a case sensitive
HTML has its own predefined tag XML you
go and create your own tags as per your
own need so HTML contents are more
static in nature XML is more dynamic
because it is designed to transport the
data from one source to the another
source here so it doesn't preserve the
wi space but yes XML does preserve the
wide spaces and then we will talk about
demo
now okay everyone so let's get started
it's a demo time now so here I will tell
you about how to develop the excepted
documents so here if you see I have got
Visual Studio code this Visual Studio
code is very simple and easy to use
editor and as a friend end developer it
is one of the most favorite tool for
every users nowadays now here if you
want to this exml base so here we have
some extensions available so if you
click on extension and search for
exml so you will see there are some okay
so XML tools are available like in
formatting okay XML document so you see
there is an uh simple XML format which
is there okay which you can use it now
so there are multiple tools are
available you can see
now XML Okay so you have got multiple
tools which are there which you can use
it anywhere to can see for XML
formatting xath as query so multiple
options are there which you can use it
as per your own requirement okay so it's
up to you now which one you want to pick
it up okay so this is the XML format is
one of the tool which is there so you
can use it so I can use this XML format
is is one of the very very common tool
which is there I'm installing this
well I close this and I go back to my
code and uh create the new file and uh
give the name called anything suppose if
I give the name called employee.
XML okay and now you can see this
extension automatically appears and uh
inside this XML okay
so if I want to go ahead and
start developing this code one by one so
how to start now so the first thing I
would like to always starts with uh my
data so I'm
saying
employees
okay so we can see now it is also
offering you one support for closing
this tag so here after that I will be
using some input by
saying employee and U inside this
employee I'll be giving the ID and say
ID equal to single code I can just give
the value
called like this okay and
now employee I'm closing
this going forward I can use the first
name
so you see like in the first name
because see these tags which I'm talking
about there are custom tags they're not
predefined on okay I'm just giving the
name called John here and uh after
this okay so along with this John I just
give the name called
Styles is the last name now be
giving
title and here I will give the value so
we can just
say
engineer okay like I can give this
another
one
Division and uh here in this division I
can
[Music]
offer materials okay after this I can
add one more property here called
building
building in building I can give the
property like you can
say seven like this and in the same one
we can offer one more property here and
that is called
room okay and I can give the room number
here which I can say like
327 okay I can say room number 190 or
anything so that's the first set of
record which I'm having right now okay
so likewise I can have n number of
records as we release wanted now okay so
let's add few more records here here to
here is an employee and let me add few
more and here I say format
document we
call XML format you can see it has
immediately formatted your data or the
complete file in a very very beautiful
way so here we
125 and here we can just give the name
call in and we can just change the
name account and uh change the name once
again like this so I like this I will
will like to have few more
records as I can see
here we want to five and give some
different way if you
want
QA we can
say
such building number
337 room
number
30 okay so like this I have got some
records with
me okay and now if I want to see how the
outcome would be so I can just right
click and say raling finder and here
when I right click and open with my
Chrome browser so you will see this is
how the document appears like there will
be nothing every browser does
contain the same format whether you use
Chrome whether you use micro
Microsoft uh Edge or any other browser
the option going to be remain same so
now we talk about one more that is
called
Json formatter and we are just saying
XML it's not very very popular tool you
can see uh XL format from here you can
see the tree structure so here I just
copy the code
and paste it here so that's what my code
which is there with me so if I just want
to say format beautify so this is how
the code will actually look like in okay
if I want to say XML tree so you can see
like there's a one object name called
employees under this we have called
three objects are available and every
object will have seven child inside this
so this is how the tree is going to
really look like and so this is
formatter can really offer something
very very
interesting and uh if you want to
perform Minify your compact so like the
size if you want to reduce it it can
also reduce the size also so that you
know you can you can consume the less
space is called XML to Json so what it
does it basically takes your XML and
convert into form of what Json in this
video you will learn what are the SS
selectors and what are their different
types so let's start by discussing the
agenda for this tutorial so in this
tutorial we will learn what are CSS
selectors and what are their different
types we will also look at an examples
to how to work with CSS selectors so
what are CSS
selectors CSS selectors allow you to
select and style HTML elements selectors
are used to find elements based on their
ID classes types attributes value of
attributes and much more let's discuss
the most common selectors there are
several different types of CSS selectors
the most common of them are CSS element
selectors CSS ID selector CSS class
selector CSS Universal selector and CSS
group selectors so what is a CSS element
selector the element selector selects
element based on the element name this
is a CSS selector it means it will
select all the P elements on the page it
will style all the P elements to the
central aligned having blue color this
is a CSS
selector it is set to P this means it
will select all the P elements on the
page it will style all the P elements to
be Center aligned having blue color
let's look at what it looks on a
page so as you can see all the elements
are centrally aligned with a text color
blue CSS ID selector the ID selector
uses the ID attribute of an HTML element
to find a specific element an ID should
be unique within the page so you should
use the ID selector to find a single
unique element to find an element within
a specific ID use a hash character
followed by the ID of the
element so here we have used the hash
paravan so all the rule will be applied
to the HTML element with ID equal to par
1 so this is an ID selector it will be
applied to all the HTML element with ID
is equal to par 1 as you can see it is
applied to the element having the ID
Paran and all the other elements are
defaultly styled CSS class selector the
class selector finds the element with a
specific class set by the HTML class
attribute to select an HTML with a
specific class use a period character
followed by the name of the class so
this style will be applied to all the
elements having the class name class one
this is a class selector it is denoted
by a period symbol all the elements
having a class name class one will be
styled with centrally aligned and color
blue as you can see the element having
the class name class one is styled and
all the other elements are set to
default CSS Universal
selector the universal selector selects
all the elements on a page the universal
selector is assigned by a star character
the universal selector selects all the
elements on a stylesheet as you can see
it is denoted by a star Mark all the
elements inside a web page will be
centrally aligned and the color will be
set to Blue as you can see all the
elements are centrally aligned and the
colors are set to Blue CSS group
selector in Styles sheets there are
often elements using the same style to
minimize the code you can group
selectors to group The selectors
separate each selectors with a comma
here we have group select selectors for
H1 H2 and P so style is applied to H1 H2
and P elements only it is better to
group The selectors to minimize the code
here we have group selectors P H2 and H3
so style will be applied to only
elements having P H2 and H3 as you can
see so all the elements of P H2 and H3
are centrally aligned and colored to Red
welcome to this tutorial on CSS Colors
by simply learn in this tutorial we will
learn how we can add colors to our page
using different methods we will start
with discussing colors and then see the
hex value and the RGB format of the
colors in the end we'll do an example to
understand how we can add colors to our
page CSS uses the color values to
specify the colors on a page they can be
specified using predefined color names
hex or RGB format there are nearly 140
standard color names hexadecimal is a
six-digit representation of a color the
first two digits are represents a red
value the next two are green value and
the last is a blue value all the other
colors can be created using the
combination of these three colors there
are several websites available where you
can know the hex value of the different
shades of color as you can see the black
color is signified by hashtag and the 6
zeros the red is # FF and the four zeros
followed by it the RGB color value is
specified using the RGB property this
property takes three values one for red
green and blue the value can be the
integer between 0 to 225 or a percentage
as you can see the black color is
signified by 0000 the red by 55 the Blue
by 00 255 and the green by 0 2550 now
let's move to an example to understand
how we can add the colors to our
page in this example we will see how we
can add colors in different ways to our
HTML so we are on the subl text RoR as
you can see we have the standard B ready
with an H2 and a paragraph on our page
open the style tag and make the font
size of the paragraph to 25 pixels so it
is clearly
visible
let's start by adding colors to our text
just by color names HTML supports nearly
140 standard color
names we'll make the color of the
paragraph green for that just type color
and set the color to
Green as you can see our paragraph is
changed to Green
let's try one
more this time we will add the color
red just
refresh as you can see the color is not
changed to Red there are nearly 140 HTML
standard colors that is supported by the
web
browser you can also add colors using
the RGB format there are many websites
available to know the RGB or hex value
of the desired color one such is HTML
ces.com as you can see in the HT cc.com
we have the hex value and the RGB value
of the desired color let's try
one we'll add this color with the RGB
value 171 229 and 27 to our paragraph So
for that just type RGB and the color
code you
want as you can see the color is not
changed to our RGB value let's try one
more this time we'll use this RV value
to our
text you can see the color is changed to
our desired
value
in this way you can use the RGB format
to change the
colors the next way is using the hex
values hexad decimal is a six digit
representation of a color the first two
digits are red next one two are green
and the last are the blue value let's
see how you can use the hex
values as you can see the hex value for
this color is # 3178
7f we'll use this value to our
text
to add the hex value you have to use the
hashtag followed by the color
code you can see that color is changed
to our x value let's try one
more you can see the hex value for this
color is # F14
a07 just copy the desired value to your
file you can see the color
changes you can also add color borders
to our heading do that just mention the
Border style along with the color
code We'll add the Border color red to
our
H2
now you can see we have the border
around our
H2 I hope you have understand how to use
the color values to your web page there
are mainly three ways by which you can
add the colors to your web page they are
Hax RGB values and the color names
welcome to this video on the CSS hor
Effects by simply learn in this video
you will learn how to add interactive
hor effects to your element we'll do an
example where we will create hor effects
to our buttons so in this tutorial we'll
discuss what is the CSS hor effects and
then we'll do an example to understand
it better so what is a CSS hor effect a
CSS hor effect is a style technique
where the user interacts with an element
with a pointing device but it does not
necessarily activate it it is triggered
when the user hovers over an element
with a pointing
device now let's jump to an
example in this example we will create
the hover effects which will look
something like this we have different H
effects for all the
buttons
so let's get started and see how you can
make this all by
yourself so we are on the Sublime Text
writer create two new files index.html
and style. CSS where we will write our
HTML and CSS code
respectively start by linking the CSS
file with the HTML
file
now we will add four anchor tags we will
specify the class name for each of them
so that we can style them separately
later put all the anchor tag inside the
div tag and name the class
middle
we'll name the class BTN BTN 1 BTN BTN 2
BTN btn3 and BTN BTN
4 just copy paste it four
times save the file and let let's see
how it looks on our page right now as
you can see we have the four text on our
page with this we are done with our HTML
part now let's shift to CSS and design
the text and add the H effects so in CSS
we'll start by setting the margin and
padding to zero we'll also add the
background body
color
as you can see the margin and padding is
now zero and we have a good background
color now we will Design the buttons and
give them proper formatting we'll start
with the class
medle set the position to
Absolute
the top property affects the vertical
position of a positioned element the
left property affects the horizontal
position of a poed element the transform
property applies a 2d or 3D
transformation to an element this
property allows you to rotate scale and
move the
elements as you can see the elements are
now in place now let's format the
buttons set the position to relative
display
block we'll keep the color as
white font size 25
pixels we will use the font family as
montis
r
keep the text decoration to
none
we will set the border to two pixel and
solid we keep the text transformation
repeat we'll keep the text
transformation as
uppercase
transition allows you to change the
property value smoothly over a given
duration the before selector is used to
insert something before the content of
each selected
elements
keep the position to
Absolute
we'll keep the transition as all 0.6
second and
eeve
let's save the file and see how it looks
on a
page now as you can see all the elements
are in place with proper background and
text we have the padding and Border
properly formatted and now we can add
the H effects to this button now we'll
add the H effects to the first
button
as you can see we have the hover effect
on our first button
ready in a similar manner we can add the
effects to the second and third Button
as
well we'll just copy and paste this
above code below and make changes to
this
code we'll set the width to 100% here
and height to
zero
we'll change it to height
100% just save the file and refresh the
page as you can see both the buttons
have the whole effects
now
now it's time to add the H effect to our
third
button
now we'll add the H effect to the button
third just save the file and go to the
page as you can see all the three
buttons are ready now it's time to add
the H effect to the fourth
button we'll set the color to Hash
FFF this will change the text color to
red when we over over the fourth
button set the position to Absolute
keep the width as
200% we'll set the background to Hash
dcd1
159
we'll keep the Zed index as minus
one keep the transition to 0.8
seconds
that
set the height to
180% of the
page now to add the H effect write the
following
code
just save the
file
refresh now you can see we have all the
H effects on our four
button welcome to this tutorial on CSS
grid layout by simply learn in this
tutorial we will discuss everything
needed for you to get started working
with grid
layouts we will start by discussing what
is a grid layout then we will move on to
the features of the grid system and some
basic terminologies which will help you
understand the grid system better in end
we will work on an example to understand
the grid system so let's get
started what is a
grid a grid is a set of intersecting
horizontal and vertical lines defining
the rows and
columns and what is a grid layout so CSS
grid layout is the most powerful layout
system available in CSS it is a
two-dimensional system meaning it can
handle both columns and rows unlike
flexbox which is largely a
one-dimensional
system you work with grid layout by
applying the CSS rules to both the
parent element which became the grid
container and the elements children
which become the grid
items the CSS grid layout excels at
dividing a page into major regions or
defining the relationship in terms of
size position and layer between parts of
a control built HTML
Primitives you can see this is the basic
layout of a grid system like tables grid
layout enables an author to align
elements into columns and rows however
many more regular layouts are either
possible or easier with CSS grid than
they were with tables for example a grid
containers child element could position
themselves so they actually overlap and
layer similar to the CSS positioned
elements so here are the features of the
CSS grid layout they are fixed and have
flexible track sizes you can create a
grid with fixed track sizes using pixels
for example this sets the grid to the
specified pixel which fits to the layout
you desire we can also create a grid
using flexible sizes with percentages
with the new F unit designed for this
purpose you can place the items into a
precise location using the grid line
numbers names or by targeting an area of
the grid the grid also contains an
algorithm to control the placement of
items not given an explicit position on
the
grid you can define an explicit grid
with a grid layout the grid layout
specification is a flexible enough to
add additional rows and columns when
needed features such as adding as many
columns that will fit into a container
are
included it also gives you control of
overlapping content more than one item
can be placed into a grid cell or area
and they can partially overlap each
other this layering May then be
controlled with the Z index
property so here are the basic
terminologies you should know to work
with the grid system
better the grid line is the dividing
line that make up the structure of the
grid they can either be vertical or
horizontal and decides on either side of
rows and columns
a grid column is a space between two
adjacent vertical grid lines the size of
a grid column is determined by the grid
template columns property on the other
hand a grid row is a space between two
adjacent horizontal grid lines it size
is determined by the grid template rows
property the grid cell is the single
unit of a CSS
grid and in Grid design a gutter is
basically the width of the space between
columns a gutter margin is the white
space formed by the adjoining inside
margins of two facing pages in a book or
a space between columns on a
page so with this let's now move on to
the handson demo and see how the GD
system works in actual word if getting
your learning started is half the battle
what if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
we are on the suam text editor open with
a project with some basic background
Styles and nothing inside the body you
can see this is a basic background style
we have pre-applied just to have a good
look of the Box
model we'll start by creating a
container and wrapping a grid items in
it so let's create a grid and give it a
class name grid
container
and inside of it we'll put our different
grid items so we'll just create
different grid items and give them a
class grid item followed by a class
number they belong to so that we can
easily distinguish between
them
just copy paste this five times so we'll
have the five elements on our
page
let's save the file and see how it looks
on the
page so you can see we have the
different grid items on the screen so
that easy for us to visualize we have
not applied any styles to them other
than the visual
Styles so we'll go back to our
code let's go back to the CSS styling
sheet so to create the grid we'll open
our style sheet we need to display grid
on our grid container so we select our
grid container and send the display to
grid if you save
now
you'll see nothing changes this is
because the grid itself doesn't Define
any rows and columns for us to work with
it just they give the alignment properly
therefore by default it looks just
exactly the same to make the grid look
actually grid we want to need to do is
Define columns and rows for a
grid so to do this you will use a set
grid template and set the column if you
want to set the size of the column uh
we'll set the size to 100 pixel and 150
pixel
now if you refresh you have the 100
pixel column on the left and a 150 pixel
column on the right and then the grid
captures our next
row but what if we want a box to
flexible size themselves according to
the items inside of them here we'll use
a fraction unit instead of a 150 pixel
column we want one fraction of our size
and instead of 100 pixel we want the two
fractions of our size so we'll just
replace with two
fractions and this with one
fraction now if you save the file and go
back to the
page you'll see that the items on our
left here in our first column are twice
as large as the item on the second
column and that's because of the F unit
we have defined you can see the
difference in the sizes the item one is
the twice of the size of the item
two another thing you can do is with
columns is use repeat suppose you want
four Columns of a size 100 pixel wide
you can just write repeat command and
inside of it how many times you want to
repeat the
size so we'll just delete
this and use the repeat we'll set the
number of times we want to repeat and
the size of
the
columns now if you save the file you
will see we have a four Columns of 100
pixel wide we can do the same things for
row just set the grid template rows and
Define the size you
want
now you can see we have the symmetric
size all around our
container if you don't know how large
your grid is going to be you can use the
grid Auto rows and this will determine
the size of all the rows that is added
after the template rows suppose we want
all our rows to be 100
pixels so we'll just delete the grid
template rows
and set the grid Auto rows 100
pixels now you can see all the rows are
now 100 pixel
tall let's change our column back to 100
pixel and 150 pixels so that it will be
easier for us
further we'll just delete this grid Auto
rows now we'll talk about the spacing of
the rows and columns apart from each
other we can do this with the help of
the grid Gap property grid row Gap will
give some spaces between the rows
similarly the grid column will give you
the spaces between the
columns
now you can see the gaps between the
rows and columns now if we want the same
value for both The Columns you can use a
grid grab property and mention the space
we'll just delete this
two and instead of it we will use just
the grid
Gap and set the size to 20
pixel now you can see the evenly spaces
between the rows and the columns
this is all you need to know about the
sizing of the different columns and rows
now let's talk about the positioning
items within its grid cells so for
horizontal positioning we could use the
justify items and we can set that to
Center
so that sentes each item within the cell
by default it is set to stretch we can
also set it to
start or
end
or space
around we will leave this to
Center to vertically position the
content we could use the Align
items
the Align items also accept the same
values we can set it to
Center we can also set this one to start
or
end
just we'll keep this to Center as
well you can also align the entire grid
within the
container so let's get rid of these to
just demonstrate them in a proper
manner we could use a justifi content
and that will align the content
horizontally within the
container we can also set this to start
or to
end just set this back to
Center to align the content vertically
we could use the Align content and the
aligned content also accepts the same
value we can set it to
Center
first
start if you inspect the
elements you can see they are aligned
centrally between the container we'll
just close
this okay so this is everything you need
to know to get started with the grid
layout grid works very similar to the
flex box but it allows you too much in
terms of laying your elements because of
its 2D nature welcome to this video on
CSS flexbox by simply learn in this
video we will learn what is a flex boox
and how it is useful in designing the
layout of the website we will also try
to understand the different properties
of flexbox with the help of an
example so let's get
started what is a
flexbox flexbox also called flexible Box
model is basically a layout mode or
model that provides an easy and clean
way to arrange the items within a
container if you are using a CSS for a
while you must have used the old block
model where you assign width in terms of
percentage or fixed width and and then
use the float to arrange the items on
the page suppose for example you want to
arrange three boxes in a row then you
have to enter everything manually from
width height and to padding flexbox can
do all these things with
ease some of the concepts of flexible
Box model is the ability to alter the
item width and height to best fit in the
containers available in the free
space flex model is Direction agnostic
which is different from the box model
which is vertically biased and the
inline which is horizontally biased
flexbox works for
both flexbox is more effective in small
scale
layouts so here are the main properties
of the
flex okay so let's jump to some code and
learn how these Flex properties work
okay so we are on the suine text trator
to get started let's add a div inside a
body here and we'll give a class of
flexbox container since this will be the
container where all our flexbox item
will
reside then inside this container we
will add another div and give it a class
flexbox item and one more class flexbox
item one which will help us to
understand which items we are referring
to when we style our elements
individually
let's just save the file and see how it
looks on a page now if you save the file
you can see we have the box because I
have already applied some of the styles
to this flexbox items let's just see The
Styling so you can see we have the item
styled just a basic styling so that we
get the box on the web
page now let's just copy these and add
two more flexbox items and you will see
we have two more boxes on our
page just copy and paste them
below give them the class name flexbox
item two and flexbox item 3 just save
the
file
now you can see we have three boxes on
the
page now to create a flex container we
will add display Flex to our Flex
container and this is how we create a
flex box
container so here we will just add
display
Flex just save the
file now you can you can see all the
items are in the same height and they
are all in the same row you will also
notice that if we shrink our browser the
items adjust themselves accordingly to
fit within the
browser now if you want to style the
elements on the main axis we will use
the property justify content inside a
flexbox container let's make it a
center save the
file now you can see the all the
elements are in the center of the page
another thing we can do is if we want
our layout to have a spaces between the
elements we will set the Justified
content to space
between you can see all the items are
now evenly spaced if you want to lay out
your items on the cross axis we would
use the Align items property the default
value for this is stretch if we want to
keep the size of our items we will use
the center and then all our items will
be Center vertically before flexbox
aligning the items vertically inside the
container was nearly impossible with
flexbox you can do it
easily now you can see the items are
aligned vertically inside the container
now let's just delete everything and
we'll just keep the display
Flex now if you want to have a column
layout instead we will use the flex
direction and change it to column Flex
Direction column now if you refresh the
page you will see all the items are
shown up in a
column now we can start talking about
the different properties that can be
applied to our different flexbox items
as opposed to flexbox container items
the flexbox container is only for laying
out and spacing between your items as
well as the positioning of your item
inside the container the actual flexbox
item properties are used to override
those item Properties or to apply
different sizing to these element now if
we want our first item that it does not
shrink when we shrink our browser we'll
set the flex shrink to zero to our first
item so we'll set the flex shrink to
zero now if you go back to the
page and try to shrink
this you'll see the first item Remains
the Same it is not
shrink now in the same way you can set
the items to grow in proportion with the
web browser suppose we want a flex box
item to to grow with the as the page
grow and cover all the empty spaces so
we'll set this Flex grow to
one now you will see the all the empty
spaces are taken by the second item
let's say we want a second box to be at
the center of the container instead of
stretching to full height we can use the
Align self property and set it to
Center
now you will see that the Ali sour
property overrides the aligned content
property of the
container you can see it is centrally
aligned so this is all you need to
understand and get started to work with
the flex boxes I hope you guys enjoyed

tutorial on CSS Box model by simply
learn in this video we will discuss what
is a box model and its various
properties we will also do an example to
understand the Box model better so let's
get
started every element that can be
displayed on a web page is comprised of
one or more rectangular boxes CSS Box
model typically describes how these
rectangular boxes are laid out on a web
page page these boxes can have different
properties and can interact with each
other in different PHS but every box has
a Content area and optional surrounding
padding border and margin
areas the following diagram demonstrates
how the content padding border and
margin CSS properties determine how much
space an element can take on a web page
the content area consists of content
like text images or other media it is
bounded by the content Edge and its
dimensions are given by the content box
width and height
the Border area is the area between the
Box padding and margin its dimensions
are given by the width and height of the
border the margin area consists of
spaces between the border and the margin
the dimensions of the margin area are
the margin box width and margin box
height it is useful to separate the
element from its
neighbors the padding area is the area
that includes the elements padding this
area is actually the space around the
content area and within the Border box
its dimensions are given by the width of
the padding box and the height of the
padding
box now let's jump to an example to
understand the Box model better so we
are on the sublime Tech serator to get
started I have created a box named
simply background color pink the font
size is 30 pixel and we have set the
border to zero solid green let's see how
it looks on our
page so as you can see we have a box
named simply learn with background going
going all the way to the end I have also
removed all the padding and margin from
the page so that the boxes are pushed
just at the corner of the page as you
can see let's start by adding a padding
of 20 pixel to the
box if you save the file you can see the
Box increased by 20 pixel from all the
sides p
inside the background of an element it
goes around the content of the element
most of the buttons inside the CSS
designed using padding so that the
background of the button becomes wider
than the actual text the next thing we
can do is change the border of the
element if you change this border size
to 15 pixel we will get a nice solid
background of color
green the Border goes around the padding
of our element so we have the 20 pixel
of padding around around the content and
15 pixel of border around the padding
which is around the
content now we'll see the working of the
margin if we add 30 pixel of margin to
our element you can see the spacing on
the outside of our
border so let's add the 30 pixel margin
and
refresh you can see the spacing on
outside of the Border margin is used to
space two elements apart from each other
now let's change these values to see the
difference
let's make the margin 40
pixels we'll make the padding 30 pixels
and let's keep the Border 20 pixels and
make it color
red This is 40
pixs let's observe the
changes so as you can see our border now
has a red background the padding is 30
pixel the margin is 40 pixel let's
inspect the elements to understand it
better by clicking on inspect you can
see the different styles here in the
computer tab you can see the Box model
this is your content area uh this is the
padding area this is the border and this
is the margin area we have the margin of
40 pixels around the border so you can
when you click on this area you can see
the margin get highlighted the B area
gets highlighted of 20 pixels this is
the padding and this is the content you
can change the size of the content by
adding the height and width so let's try
adding height and width we'll give the
height 50 pixels and we'll give the
width also 50
pixels just save the
file now when you refresh you can see
the content 15 to 50 welcome to this
tutorial on CSS key frames by simply
learned in this video we will discuss
what are key frames and how you can use
them to add animations to your page we
are going to discuss what are key frames
and we'll try to understand the syntax
of the key frames so let's get
started the key frames are used to
specify the animation code in the page
they're used to change the animation
from one pattern to another keep in mind
that the key frames do not have any
selectors on them they're not lested
inside anything they're on the root of
the CSS page you write at theate Key
frames and the name you can name it
anything you want we are going to use
that name later on to call the selector
in this case we are looking at from and
two from implies the initial State and
to the ending State here in this example
the element will start from 0 pixel and
will go all the way to 100 pixel so what
we are going to do right now is we are
going to jump to the key frames and work
out some examples to understand the
working of the key frames better if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more so we are on the sublime
techer and this is a simple setup we
have created one HTML element named box
and we have a CSS body of padding 50
pixel and the Box element is an inline
block background Rend with height and
WID 200
pixel and also I have an animation St
declared on the box currently it's doing
nothing because it is calling key frames
called my frames but we have not yet
created any key frame we will disc what
these animation line means at later
stage but right now I need those lines
to be able to explain you to the
functioning of the key
frames you can see we have a box on our
page with the color red and padding 50
pixels around it we are going to write
add the key frames and I'm going to use
the name my frames then we'll write
prompt condition to have the starting
State and let's just keep the height 200
pixel and then we want it to grow and we
will set it to increase till 500 pixels
so let's just create our key frames
this is a prom
condition we'll set it to 200
pixels and we want it to grow till 500
pixels just save the
file
now as you can see our box is growing
all the way to 500 pixel and when the
animation is done it resets back to 200
pixel and starts again because the
animation is looping you can also put
multiple style declaration for example
I'm going to write background pink in
the two
condition just save the
file
you can see that the animation is
starting at red and ending at pink now
instead of saying PR and to you can also
say from 0% to 100% this is as same as
doing from and two but what it enables
you to do is you can add something in
the middle of here say 30% and we will
make the color any different so in the
place of PR we'll write
0% and we'll replace true with
100%
let's just add one more condition in
between say
40% so at 40% we want the color to
change to say something uh
green let's save the file and see how it
looks on the
page so as you can see it starts with
red it turns to Green in the middle and
then all the way converts to Pink as you
can see there are lots of interesting
things you can do with the key frames
all of the things that I'm showing you
today are just like how this works to
really get a great understanding of how
it works you just have to open your
editor and start experimenting on
it okay so now let's go back to our code
and learn about the animation
property so here we have the animation
name my frames the animation name should
be as same as key frames name to work it
properly the animation duration
specifies for how long we want our
animation to last in this case 2 seconds
let's just change this to say 10
seconds just save the
file now as you can see the animation is
going at a slower speed just to cover
the 10 seconds of
that let's just reset it to 2
seconds the timing function used to
mention the transition there are some
keywords such as EAS in linear EAS in
out and some more the animation delay is
interesting to understand it means how
long we are going to wait once the
animation is triggered before the visual
starts
happening let's change it 2 3
seconds as you can see the animation
starts after the 3 seconds iteration
count specifies how many times the
animation should happen here we have set
it to
infinite which means animation will keep
on going let's change it to something
say
five as you can see after the count of
five the animation stops we'll set it
back to
infinite animation learning State can be
paused or the running
State welcome to this video on CSS
tricks by simply learn in this video we
will discuss some cool tricks that every
web developer should be familiar with
and which will help you during the time
of your designing of your web page so
let's jump onto the Sublime Text Editor
and see these tricks so the first trick
is called the CSS blend mode the CSS
background blend property sets the blend
mode for each background layer and you
can blend it with image or with
different colors with the help of this
property we can blend back background
image or blend them with colors so
here's an example of the CSS blend mode
here you can see the images are blended
with different
colors so let's see how we can achieve
this so for our example purpose I'm
going to use this image to our
page
so in the body tag add the image URL and
the location of a
file keep the margin left and margin
right to
Auto now let's add some style to a body
tag in the bled mode there are several
modes such as normal multiply dark
lighter or screen let's blend that image
with one color so you can select the
color from this HTML color codes I'll
use this color for my purpose so just
copy paste
here and in the background blend mode
let's keep it to
lighten now if you
save and then refresh
here you can see we have Blended our our
image with color let's go back and
change here something different let's
keep it to
darken let's try something PR let's keep
it to
screen so as you can see there are
several properties for this blend mode
and you can use according to your needs
the next trick is called clipping the
CSS clip Pass Property creates a
clipping region that specifies the
region that should be shown on the page
so let's understand this with the help
of an example here we'll create a div
and give them class any class say TR the
easiest way to generate the clip value
is to use a
generator there are several websites
that give
the value of the clip so we'll use this
website to generate our clip
value
suppose we want a hexagon shaped image
on our page so here you can adjust it
according to your needs the any shape
that you
want here you can see the clip value
just copy paste it from
here now here we'll use that class that
we have specified we'll just copy paste
the clip value here we'll keep the
height to say 50% uh let's say
60% set the width to 60% as
well select the color you want to give
to your clip image I'll use the same
color from the previous
example so just copy paste this color
code
keep the position to Absolute and the Z
index to minus
one just save and go back to the page
and
refresh now you can see we have the clip
image on our page let's try something
different um let's say I
want a left
Arrow so just copy paste this clip
value clip path
[Music]
value just save the
file and you can see we have the arrow
on our page another must have for web
developers is animations CSS allows us
to animate almost every property that we
use in the CSS let's look at what an
example so here in HTML file we'll just
add one D tag
first and to start with animation we'll
have to mention a key frame the key
frames allows us to create different
steps for our
animations we'll keep the key frames
name to
Blink so here in this example we'll
create a box and we'll add different
colors at different points of animations
right so we'll write 0% and we'll set
the background to
Indigo we change the colors five times
so just copy paste this code five
times we want next change at 30% so
we'll set the background here suppose
say
red at 50% we want wanted
yellow at 70 we want it
green and finally we'll change it to say
blue so inside the div tag we'll mention
the height and width of the Box first
let's say 400 pixels and width also 400
pixels now we'll mention the border of
the box so just set it to say 1
pixel solid
black now for the animations
part we'll set the animation for 10
seconds and for infinite number of
times write this web kit so as to
support in our Google
Chrome
now just save the file and go back to
our
page and here you can see we have the
animation on our
box we can style each and every elements
in HTML using
animations another thing you can do is
add CSS gradient the CSS gradient
property allows you to add smooth
transitions between two or more colors
for this purpose we can get the gradient
value from a website called cssg
gradient. here in this website you can
get the mix and match of the different
colors you want to use let's look at one
example to understand better so here in
this HTML file first let's set the
height so we'll set the height to
100% now inside the body
tag we'll keep the height as
100% we mention one background
color let's select different color this
time so we will use save this color this
time just copy paste the value here
now for the gradient value just go back
here in this weite and you can select
the color you want let's say I want a
mix of this
color and you can change the shades from
here
now when you're done with the colors
just go back below and copy this code
here to your
page now when you go back to the page
you'll have a beautiful gradient
here
let's try one
more this time a linear
gradient just copy this value to your
code
just save the file and go back to the
page and we will have a linear gradient
here so today is very exciting day
because today we're going to help you to
understand like how you're going to be
developing some very attractive website
having the CSS HTML and lot of images in
a
packet this mini project will help you
to understand how we can align our ENT
to display to my end user so lot many
things are there we have a got CSS in
place we have HTML in place and using
some CSS 3 based effects using some HTML
5 based effects we will be creating our
mini website having some single HTML
page and a CSS and lot of images will
help you to understand in case if I want
to develop a website how to Kickstart
them okay so let's get started so this
is my folder I've created called web Pro
and in a similar folder I'll be creating
some of the files so my first file will
be called
styles do CSS so in this styles. CSS
first of all I need to import some of
the fonts which I will be using it
throughout my development so I'm saying
atate import URL and here I'll be
offering the location by
saying
https
fonts
dot
Google
apis. okay
google.com/
CSS okay question mark we have to use
family equal to here we can use
Alura Alura and with using this pipe
symbol we using Jo's f
chose fil plus sense so that is the URL
for me in case if you want to verify
whether this URL does exist or not so
what you can do you can just copy this
and go to your browser and uh try to
paste this and check if it does exist
yes it does exist that means this URLs
are available to us so this is a URL
which I'll be using it for my
development after that I'll be using
this as estri and providing some of the
core features like a
margin colon zero followed by other
details okay like I'm saying margin col
0
n adding once again zero followed by box
sizing this we saying bot
box followed by
outline okay
none okay and uh post this we'll be
offering list of
style here we are also saying
none after that text
decoration text decoration once again
none uh after that font
family font family so we are using
this this option which you're saying
called Jo
f
okay s the one which you have used comma
we're using one more called
SS hyph s so this would be a first set
of the style which will be Global to all
I'll be using this well earlier we have
given the common style to all now I'll
be giving a style to my paragraph so
here in my paragraph We trying to say
margin
hyphen Bottom I want to give all 15
pixels because I want to develop all the
Styles well in advance before I proceed
ahead we are saying font hyphen
size yeah font hyphen size that we want
to give it called 14
pixels followed by line
height line height I'll give 20
pixels after that color
color you can give
anything okay so there's one very common
color called Light Blue for that there's
one value called
5 F okay 8 e 8
e and again 8 e you can see that is
called a kind of light green color which
is coming up now okay which is used now
a part of this paragraph we'll be using
H1 title
okay H1 title and in this H1 title we
are saying margin
bottom margin bottom we saying 20
pixels after that
color
orange okay uh let me put semicolon here
along with this font
family
this font I'm be giving
Allura okay along with this we also want
to give
c
c okay also text
transform this text transform I want to
use
uppercase along with this font
size
this font size I would like to give 38
pixels followed by font
size yeah so this font size I want to
give is called 38
pixels or font SI we have already given
word spacing we have to
give this word spacing will given 25
pixels followed by letter
spacing uh letter spacing will five
pixels so these are the details we have
given for the H1 title okay so now we'll
be talking about our buttons which are
the L field we have to go provide to our
button so we are saying once again do
BTN okay space a means under my button
tag a what I want so I
say
width one 80
pixels one
second yeah withth 180 pixels we giving
height 35
pixels followed by line
height line height we're giving 35
pixels followed by
border this border will be 2 pixels
solid
black okay after that
color color we want to give it I would
say red would be sufficient enough
followed by
display display I want to give it as
called
block followed by
margin margin I want to give 25
pixels
Auto and
zero followed by text
align
okay Center so this is for BTN a which
we have given along with this BTN a
there are some other properties are also
available like in dot
maincore container here we will like to
provide
position
okay colon
relative okay after this position we
would like to also provide the property
for
Navar so we are saying
Navar underscore or let's talk about Nar
rest of the stats will be offering it a
little later with this Nar we are
providing this
width okay this width will be
100%
okay this width be 100% And also we
provide
height this height will be 65
pixels okay provided by
position position we are providing
absolute after that we s
display display we are providing
Flex after that we are seeing justify
content
justify contents we are seeing space
around after that we saying align
items this we are giving a
center okay along with this we are
giving this logo of type
A so inside this logo we are saying font
family this font family we are once
again using the same
the one which you have used earlier you
remember Alura and C let me we can use
the same whatever we have used it
earlier so same condition you can use it
here so we remember earlier what we have
used in my previous program okay font
family so the same font family I would
like to use it here
also okay so logo a but let me check
somewhere down the line for wait
font family so let me copy the
same and past here right now okay so we
have got font family with me which we
have taken it right now to my existing
logo a along with I want to use called
font size I would like to use 32
pixels also
color and as usual I would like to use
R okay so that is for logo on which we
have basically applied this a part of
this we would like to also use for
Navar Navar
uncore
item space
ul and here we would like to provide
margin
zero and
padding again zero followed by line
style list style
sorry
list style here we saying none see that
is the benefit of having this Visual
Studio code because sometime when you're
going wrong it immediately give you the
idea of like saying like hey you're
going somewhere wrong that's why the
suggestions were not given to us so till
here we've added furthermore we'll be
adding few more Styles into my code well
next nav bar till UL we have seen now
followed by same do Navar okay
underscore items followed by UL which we
have it and along with this we would
like to go ahead with this list items
also and in this list items we need few
details first I talk about called float
so float left for sure then we talk
about called
width width will be 100
pixels and now we talk about color
height height will be 40
pixels well float width height we have
talked about now we talk about called
background
color background color we can say light
Salamon that looks nice and
opacity opacity we can just give call
Point
8 followed by line
height line height I can give call 40
pixels okay along with this we also want
Textra line once again
Center okay this is for these items now
under the same nav bar you may have some
other properties also okay okay this is
for naar UL Li and we can also have the
same
property
copy but along with this Li I can also
have this anchor tag so we can select
multiple elements together so here I
would like to offer text

same and with this anchor I can have the
property name called what
hob so what property you are expecting
for this so here in my home property I
can say background
color and I can

anchor tag what should happen so this
conditions I want to utilize because I
want to offer some of the animations
Behavior right over there so what
animations I would like to go ahead that
I need to offer under this navigation
items Ali so I just copy
this paste it below but this over which
we are talking about we would like to
change
from to
after
okay after so I'm removing this
background color with this because
background color can be changed to
something else so I can change to
white white well let me have few more
properties to we get added first thing
we are trying to say called
position Position will be
absolute okay you want from left
side left I want to give 50% base after
this from
bottom I'm saying
zero okay now I want to talk about
called transform you remember there a
property available in CSS
and here we are
saying
translate X and inside this translate X
I say minus
50% okay and here we are saying after
that
scale
X okay and here we providing what
zero so that's what the condition we
want to provide it for the transform and
the next thing will be transform
origin transform origin so I say

50% after this we would like to talk
about
width width will be

height height will be 2 pixels
okay withd 100% height 2 pixels after
that we talk about
transition and this transition we can
talk about called
transform okay transform to 50
[Music]
Ms okay so these are so far the details
which are available with us which I
would like to use it in my code
okay that is for after of this anchor
tag so when we talk about hover you
further want to change the behavior over
there so in this case I would like to
use the
same condition I just copy
that and here let me say
colon so you can see
Al space a colon over colon after
so what conditions you want to use it
here
so
transform okay so
here translate
X okay so here you say
minus
50% is scale
X
1.0 followed by we would like to use
again Dot
naar okay underscore

once again UL once again Li and here in
this case we want to offer display
none
display
none okay so that's okay and one more
conditions I would like to take it here
is
here when I say you Al Al colon H so I
can say
Al
colon over UL Li so we will say
display
block that's the
condition okay so so far we have written
this much of CSS we would like to go
ahead and try to implement some of the
HTML behavior and we'll be back to our
CSS to make this possible okay one so we
have developed a lot about CSS it's time
for us to move towards our next UI that
is called the HTML part okay so
here I've already kept it just for the
kind information I've just downloaded
few of the
images okay from the internet just to
utilize into my
application and going to create the
another file and give the name called
index.htm
okay this index. HTML file let me have
this template with me okay so I have a
got template with me now here uh we want
to use some of
the awesome csss styles for of my usual

Styles sheet and HF equal to now I'm
going to give the location so this CSS

stylesheet we are giving the version
called

all sorry all do
min. CSS so that is a location actually
okay now I want to just check whe this
location does exist or not so I'll just
copy this and paste it in my browser to
verify well yes this style does exist so
we would like to go ahead and continue
well I would like to give some title in
case if you want so this a called
document I can just give the name

to give ID equal to

with this I want to give some other type
of div tags too where I want to use it
now here within this div tag I want to
give another div tag where I want to
provide a naar so
t equal to

use another div tag which
says class equal
to

provide this
hash okay and this will be provided
to home see this is we have a got div

tag the div tag is getting closed and we
would like to start another div tag and
in this D tag we would like to say class
equal
to
naar
underscore
items okay within this div tag we would
like to use this ul and within this UL I
would like to use this Ali okay and in
this Li uh we would like to bring
some AHF equal to
Hash that is the link which I need to
provide
okay so in this anchor tag we want to
provide a location called home here
there the first list item which is there
like this I can provide some other list
items too like I can talk about call
about we saying
hash about and here we
say about here so this anchor tag is
getting
closed okay and uh here before I close
this list item here here we would like
to take another UL
tag okay in this UL tag we would like to
paste this list item again and here with
this hash we can just give the name
call something whichever you want to
give

closed Li is also getting closed
here okay after this we can provide few
more Li tags here okay so HF equal to
here we would like to provide a real URL
now remove the hashtag and say
https
simply le.com
SL corporate
Pyon training okay and here we will be
giving the option called
Services This falls into the category of
what services like this we would like to
provide one more anchor tag for contact
us
let's
say
contact one more for call our
team okay and here we
say our
team okay let me go back to my index.
HTML file and check the
status well it looks pretty nice now
here we have got simply learn solution
with us and right hand side you can see
now here in about you see how the things
are working for me this links are coming
up automatically it came because here if
you remember in my code when I was
saying this about okay this was a part
of our current code and due to that it
is now making it possible for us and
that is possible because here in my
style. CS is if you remember we were
using this a kind of naar UL Li okay so
the moment I try to
hover okay so this was giving me the
complete details and due to that I was
in position to get all the details so
looks pretty
nice okay so going forward what I would
like to do is within my program as I
could see in my index.html file we have
provided this tag so UL is getting
closed this div is getting closed this
div is also getting closed okay now here
we would like to start another
table we say Dev class equal to Banner
image
Banner image okay now within this div I
would like to use one more div tag
within this div we
say class equal
to Banner underscore
content okay Banner _ content now within
this div class we would like to use this
H1 here we can say welcome
to welcome to Simply learn okay after
this Break Tag as you know that is a for
break and
now in this is pan tag we can say
words okay
words number one boot
G okay here the H1 tag is getting closed
after that the paragraph tag within this
paragraph We Can
Say
get
certified
get ahead this value after this the div
tag is getting closed the second D tag
is also getting closed let me
check okay so that we need to organize
it uh in a better way so but initially
we have a got welcome to safety learn
words number one boot capap now how how
my look and feel is really going to help
because this Banner part I want to
organize it because I do not have a CSS
for this clear so certainly I need a CSS
to organize this particular Banner
getting it because when we talk about
called Banner content so I need to tell
where it needs to go because I also
would have some Banner image also too so
I'll go back to my CSS now and in my
style CSS here let me say Banner
content Banner
[Music]
uncore
content and here we can
say text align Center and say
color you can
say white
smoke okay and also within this Banner
content we want to use the H1 tag within
this H1 tag you have to just say text
transform upper
case and line
height line height 38
pixels okay and margin
bottom this margin bottom we want to use
15
pixels okay so that's when we have it
let me close
this sorry and here we want to use one
more property called Banner content with
H1 and the span tag so that I can change
the color so
here Banner
content H1 we also want to use span tag
within this I want to say color and you
can just
sayato and let's check does it affect in
my application yes exactly it does
affect now you can see it is somewhere
coming down the line like
this okay so I can further change
it to my
application like if I talk about about
and and all so this I can change it for
sure because if I have some images also
those images I also want to change
towards my application but it is just a
simple part we are talking about called
Banner part and we have also have to
take some images through for this Banner
image so let's go back and talk about
our index.html file and see what some of
the banners I want to utilize it
here okay now when we talk about called
get ahead I certainly need some of the
banner image too but Banner image is not
available so let me go back and try to
use some Banner image whichever we have
to Define under my CSS okay so here in
my style CSS let me go here and say
dot Banner
uncore
image in this Banner image we have to
say background
URL background colon now you have to say
URL and in this URL we have to use this
image called
images
slp4 do
jpg that will be my image and also we
would like to use one very common option
that is called No repeat so that it
should not repeat it and I want to fix
it to the top and in a
center okay now let's
check perfect it is coming up but it is
not looking as good as it looks like in
so we want to use few more important
things saying this background
size background size cover and I also
want to use
width width I want to use
100% and
height we want to use it call
600% okay display
we want to use it
flex and uh justify
content we want to use it called
Center and align
items Center let's check this
out okay now you can see it looks pretty
better compared to the previous version
whatever we have written it but this
image needs to be look even more better
okay and the content needs to be more
awesome but anyways that is the first
thing which we have written after that
we have to write an About Us and other
areas but that is initially which I
would like to make it even more better
and more
look
okay okay so we have seen the Valu still
the call option called get certified get
ahead the D tag is getting closed and I
want to use of
div and inside this div we want to say

big so I just want to make them small
but initially they are okay okay you can
see we have a call our

have got this images with us what those
images are if we just check here we have
a call def service

that's how you see your websites are

compar to the previous one now they are
aligned properly and you can see here
these images are really
nice okay that's the benefit so we have
this let
Mees yeah and uh once this image part is

pixels okay for this H3 and when it
comes to this text boxes certainly you
can change the look and feel how you
really want it so for this you can say

bottom 15
pixels okay for form input now in a
similar line uh form input we may have a

we want to offer some of the details
like I'm talking about like in width we
talk about padding let's talk about like
in width I'm saying 250
pixels okay we said
adding we say 12
pixels
and 20 pixels we talk
about
height 80 pixels we talk about
reze we talk about none we say

pixels
solid
and white this is for this and in a
similar one I can use it for the text
box so form colon input whatever we have
used it form reer form input so let me
copy
this okay form input and uh here we say
input equal
to type of
text so
what combination you'll be using so I'll
be using width padding and
Border
copy I need width padding and Border
height and three size we removing it
and awesome so they look pretty nice
okay so we have this uh three text boxes
with us and uh all are looking nice the
way we are expecting from our
application okay so that's the one
which my application is offering about
this text area and all so that looks
really nice the way we are expecting
right now okay
so what are the areas we have seen TI
Services
item and everything whichever we were
saying like this so let's go back and
check to my index.html
file so we have a
call form rapper which is the
outermost okay you see now here it
contains lot many things so here in
my program and I see like form
rapper okay formore rapper do form input
and uh talk about like the other details
talk about input type equal to
text you see like the border is like
that so if you want to have this border
some different
color and certainly use
black now you can see it looks pretty
nice because earlier it was looking like
pretty much different now at least I can
see here the location has been
given okay uh so going back towards the
previous HTML p okay so we had a call a
submit button with us okay after this
the all three div tags are getting
closed and now onwards we would like to
start working with Team
details so we are saying
div so
D plus equal
to our team and uh ID equal to
te
again okay and now we want to use this
H1 tag here this H1 tag we
say
class class equal to title and here I
say our in a H1 tag now once it is over
we will use again another div tag which
having class equal to our team
rapper our
teamore
rapper now within this D
tag uh we want to use one more D tag
here in this class equal
to
teamore or Team hyph
1 base
team that is a div tag now here we will
be using a lot of other div tags inside
this like I say
div class equal to team
members team
members okay and uh data hyen name equal
to you can give any name like let's give
the name call
it's space k okay and within this I want
to use one image
tag IMG space SRC equal
to images SL team
1.
jpeg okay so that's the first thing we
have it so this D tag is close now uh I
copy the
same so total I want to use this three 1
2 three and here team members I would
like to change the name here rather than
clay let me give the name
called abijit and uh one more that is
called okay and change the name to
2
453 okay so this is the first div we
have used it so this D tag is getting
closed right over here along with this
the second D tag is getting closed so
after having
this two div tags closed we want to use
another one so for team
two okay so I just copy the
same
okay
uh I would like to go ahead
with Team to team so team
members and uh here I would like to say
four five
four
five six and change the name like you
can give anything I just give the name
called
suppose
Aran
other
and so these names we using it now let's
go back and see how it really
looks so these images are coming like
that okay so we want to use those images
in somewhere not like this or horizontal
or vertical so this for fix that issue I
have to once again look back to where to
my
Styles okay where this option can be
used in better way I like to go back to
my
style.css and want to use the first
option
calledd
background
sorry
background now here we
say white smoke now again our
team
rapper so in this I would like to say
display
flex and flex
Direction SP
oh sorry
column let's check how it really looks
like in there's no much change
but certainly few more classes can
really make a difference so our
team okay underscore
rapper let's check this the same name we
have used it
yes our
team now in the same way we want to use
this team so again our team
rapper okay dot team
display flex and justify
contents space
between
okay now here when we talk about team we
also want to say uh our
teamore reer do
teamore
[Music]
members here we would like to give
it how much
30% and height
this will be
Auto and uh here will be having
cursor pointer for sure and
overflow
hidden and
position relative this is for team
members now you can see it looks better
now now we have to basically divide
those because we have got separate team
members are available so we have to also
divide them to so here after this we
want to
say
dot our team rapper and again
dot team
members space
IMG these images we say
display
block
withd 100%
okay
height Auto
okay
transition transition or transition I
can say or type
all like
this okay and uh in a similar way
copy this team and we'll say
members over image then we can
say
transform
scale
1.1 that's
it okay so we have
this look and feel appeared
okay width transition image H so they're
all ready with us okay everybody so
after writing all those the only
difference I made it like I had used
hyphen but I'm using underscore here

slash simply learn
underscore underscore
e-learning okay and I want to use the
same option there
also
I and with
this remove this okay so here just give
the name called fa
Hy
Instagram now let's go back and
check okay so you can see now we have
got this links coming up for Facebook as
well as what of this Instagram so that
looks really nice that gives us a
feeling of yes exactly the code the way
we are looking forward for it is working
the way it was
expected okay and uh if you want to
offer any other type of details that
also you can offer but this is the first
thing which we have taken so this is the
navigation links are available these
navigation links you can also change the
way they always look forward for so I'll
be providing some links which we can
later on use it okay everyone so finally
we all ready so I have basically added
some of the additional styles to my code
you can see here from this point onwards
we added this image URL this is for body
this is for Star container row UL this
is for footer this is for footer column
so because we're also using some footer
portions into my code as you can see we
call Pho column and Pho class equal to
what footer so implemented this footer
background color equal to Black we have
used it padding 70 pixels photo column
phot column because we using this H4 tag
also you remember like we're using this
H4 tag also so for all H4 tags this
would be the basic
setting for footer column H4 before we
would like to give the contents like
this by giving this background color
height box sizing width and and all
photo column UL Li not last side we're
going to give this margin bottom and
this is the style for photo column UL Li
and list
items clear and here you can see this
font size we're giving it this is for
hover this is for photo column where we
have for Social Links whichever we have
created it is showing me that display
inline block margin border radius and
this is for Social Links when I try to
click on or over it so the color will
change to this white color and the media
this is for responsiveness to make sure
like in case if I reduce the size of my
browser they look better the way it is
expected so when the line size will
change to 720 pixels so this color will
be change and this is the styles for
Arrow photo one these all we have
implemented and finally my application
when I refresh it actually looks like
that see now this is the photo area of
my
application so I'm sure that this looks
even more better and convenient because
when I try to reduce the size you see
now it's still going to give you the
responsiveness can you see this now this
is going to give you the responsiveness
reason because here we are using this
Logic for media when the change of width
will to 720 pixels if it is going to 767
pixels so like that you implement that
so guys our project is now ready I'm

Z that's it and in the same time we talk
about call add
button okay colum
for background to change to
be that's it let's
check awesome
so you see now how exactly is WR
now so my to list CSS part is over okay
well after this we're going to talk
about our GS file which is the most
important area of your code now here let
me close down
everything and start creating another
file here one is called
app.js the main calculation goes here so
from this point onwards we would like to
start working with the property uh
whichever we have created here on the
top of that will we start working here
okay so in my CSS what are the things
are
required that you want to understand
okay so we talk about option called Li
Li stand for what list items so let's
start working
with my
list equal to
document get element by ID or also I say
element by tag
name and the tag name is what L let
called list items okay after that we
creating r i is a variable then for I =
to0 I is less
than not
list my list do length and then
i++ okay later on we have to create
our span equal to document do create
element document create element which
element I want to create
it SP I can WR
Capital span tag I want to created after
that
war text or I can say txt equal to
again document do create text
node and I'll just give the value here
Asing forward
slash
to be Crea new
text okay later on we just say
span do class
name span do class name equal
to close after that
exp
dot open
chain txt and then
my own
list I
dot up
CH so the first function which we have
wred okay so there's the name called
node list this just a typical logic in
fact I would not even say the function
it's just a logic which you
WR after that
uh what we need to do now is
uh we have to start working with our
option called
R close equal
to document do get El by
class get El by class name name is
called
what CL okay and say or I and uh once
again for
Z
less close.
length
i++ Okay
then
close
I
dot on
cck okay close I do on equal
to
function and now here we say
r d equal to this
dot parent
element this dot parent El and now we
say
style display equal
to okay and
now next thing so this is for when you
try to click on a close button to hide
the current list
item okay we can
say
correct okay now next what we to develop
the Cod is is to basically add a check
symbol okay while clicking on the list
item that means if any items you
basically clicked so what should happen
now so when so it will get stried saying
that hey this task is over now so we can
say
V list
document query
selected
you okay and I
say add event
here on which event on a click event and
then I need to write what function which
takes event as in parameter
okay here I see
if
do Target
dot class
list dot
tole toggle here I say
checked
okay and what should happen
now but before that I just need to check
the condition for if ev. target. tag
name just
wait e.
target. then what
then
do Target
do class lest
dot
to
check okay and here we pass a value
called
false that's
it okay now you have to basically go and
create what functions for this
so after that I'm going to create a new
function now and
function
new okay here we say V La equal to
document
dot create
element which element I want to create
it and right
then input value equal to
document
dot get El by
ID
item
do okay and after that we just calculate
in this value we are saying
v t equal
to document do create text
Noe okay here we
pass input value here and I say
l up child of
D like this and here we seeing
if
input
value equal to blank nothing is there
then what so in such cases we can say
alert is basically the validation for me
alert this field cannot be
empty
okay this field cannot be empty so this
is first error page we showing the else
condition in else condition you to say
document
dot get element by
ID okay which is a type of
item okay so taking about item which is
a type of
so else condition which is saying
document would element by ID rather than
item let's pass list here and inside
this list we'll
say do up
child and here we will be passing
what okay otherwise what would happen we
talk about this option called to by ID
item
item
value equal to
BL okay that's the case now after that
we can start working with our span tag
now and the span tag will have its own
condition so first we check about this
and now we talk about how span tag so we
just say how this we say
or or span equal
to
sorry document
do get element sorry document dot create
element document create element of type
what
spare
okay so we using span equal to document
do create element of type of span here
so after this a span we be talking about
our next feature now so this after this
is span will
be yeah so we now talking about Kar
tht equal to once again
document do create
text we talk about
you
so up that
span
dot
upen
txt okay and then in the same line we'll
be using l dot up and
child do up and child
SP and then last but not least we have
to basically iterate through all
for I equal to 0 I is less than
close. length and
i++ then
close of type I we are passing it
dot on click equal
to
function and here we saying
V div equal to this
do parent
element okay and D
do style dot display equal to
so so friends we are almost ready now
because our JavaScript file is ready
after that we'll be talking about how to
include it in HTML to take a look with
well everybody so we are all set now
since we have our application ready with
me GS is ready CSS ready now our index.
HTML file you have to just check how to
apply this GS within my code now so in
my index. htl file I'll just go to my
the bottom of my page that is call
script script
SRC equal to the name call
appjs that's it okay and let's check
about my final
outcome okay so you can see now the
cross bar automatically appeared okay
with my application let me try to add
another one that is
called welome see it is automatically
getting the moment I click you can see
it is strike that means it is done if I
try to click on this it goes off if I
click it here strike click here
strike add
another it's also working delete it
click it again it is uncheck or un
strike now so guys that's it so we are
happy like finally we have finished one
of our very important project which is
called to do application soall
calculator application so let's get
started let me try to delete first those
files which we really do not need it
now uh we delete those all yeah now I'll
be creating a new folder now and give
the name
called calculator app and in this
calculator app once again we need some
new files which is called
index.
HTML and we also need one more that is
called app.
CSS and another one that is called
app.js so these three files required now
first of all I would start with
index.html file where we'll be creating
a template of my code now let me go and
create this template and here have a got
body with
me let's start with the
first tag here that is called H1 and
this H1 we are giving the name called
calculator
calculator app so that will be my H1
heading after that we'll start working
with the div
tag now within this div I have to create
lot many classes I may not have lot many
CSS classes but we can give some classes
here so we can say class equal
to
container okay so within this div tag
we're going to create a table now
because I want to organize it
so I'm starting with the table within
this table TR tag and within this TR tag
I need a TD now in this TD I need few
things call call span equal to three
other value and here I want to offer the
text box input type equal
to
text okay input uput text ID equal to
give the name called result
that will be the final outcome while
pressing all the different buttons ID
equal to result and class equal
to screen remember I haven't created two
CSS classes but but we giving some names
but later on we can utilize it while
creating those CSS classes table data is
getting closed let's get started with
another TD now insert TD we need another
text
box input type equal
to text and uh here if this input to
text sorry I would like to better say
button because I'll be having
buttons
okay input app equal to button
value equal to
C and uh on click equal to
I may not have any function right now
but yes I can create a function but let
me give some dummy name here I'm saying
clear
screen okay so that will be the function
will get called and after that
class equal to
clear yeah so this is my button
tag after this the TD tag is getting
closed after the T tag the table row is
also getting closed after the table row
which is getting closed we're going to
start working with another table
row okay and in this table row I'm going
to create one more TD so let's go and
create another TD here and inside this
TD I'll be having another button to be
get created so I'll just
say there's my another button now input
equ to button value equal
to one on click equal to I'll be calling
another function called
display okay and uh inside this we
giving the value called
one okay and class equal to
number class equal to number and here
after that TD tag is getting
closed okay okay now we have to start
another TD tag here okay like that we
have to keep on creating the multiple
buttons so let me
copy and place another table data now
here again value equal to two on to
display give the value called two and
class equal to what number like that
I'll keep on creating multiple buttons
but first check how it actually looks
like
it now I can see the buttons like in c 1
2 3 but yes I'm going to create few more
buttons one after another okay so I'll
go here and create few more buttons so
this is where the table data is getting
closed okay I'll copy this and paste it
again have to
create the button like in 3 4 something
like that
so after this two we're giv the value
called
three yeah I get the value called three
so value equal to 2 value equal to 3
display three and then
afterwards just giving the value called
forward
slash and here also we going to get the
value called for Slash and here class
equal to
Operator Operator after that we have to
give the value called four and Then
followed by 56
7 so here we give
four
four
5
five
six six after six we're giving call
[Music]
minus okay once again it will be what
type of
Operator
Operator okay after this minus we'll be
talking about code
7 then we have to have eight
okay
9 okay after that we giving C
plus and
display Plus Class equal to
Operator Operator okay so here you can
see the table data is getting closed and
here the table row is also getting
closed and after this table row we can
start working with another table row
here and
uh after this table row we can start
working with again TD let me have
this
again inside this I'll be giving the
option called decimal which is value
equal to
Dot and here we give the value called
decimal
de okay now display zero so after given
this dot we to basically take what the
value zero which we have input now we be
talking about value call zero so here
the decimal value we have given it DD is
getting closed let me have the another
one
Z
zero so like that we have to give this
now after that if be once again taking
this this time rather than giving this
zero we'll be using this call as a
button and value equal to equal to on
click equal
to Sol okay and in this Sol will not be
passing anything it like a normal
function and class equal to
equal okay so table data is getting
closed so we will be using another table
data
now so here it will be the button
only okay we'll be using value equal to
multiplication
display ttic and here'll be using
operator okay so table data is getting
closed table R is getting closed table
is also getting closed here okay so your
D tag is also getting closed here okay
that's it okay so that's the only thing
which we wanted to make let me try to
refresh and check
awesome so we have got U all those
necessary calculator Behavior which uh
we wanted to
reveal okay now our next statement will
be once we giving this C then you have
call 1 2 3 and then forward slash
followed by 456 will come
down okay so let me check whether we
have used six or
not
okay so we haven't used six so let me
check
here
456 so let me go back
here 4 five 6 let me copy
this and paste it later
on before
minus
6 equal to
number okay so we almost set now so we
are having this uh Lo in feed in this we
giving 1 2 3 4 5 6 and after this we
have a call minus and then plus related
Behavior so we are all set now and after
that we'll be basically apply the CSS as
well as the JavaScript look towards my
code okay thank you well everybody we're
all good to go now but I just want to
first check whether my uh this Outlook
is looking properly or not see what my
expectation is after 1 2 3 forward slash
I really want to bring 456 to the next
and then 789 and again forward but I can
think this is absolutely unorganized so
after this when we say this uh forward
slash which we have used after hyen okay
your TD is getting closed here okay so
here the TR I also want to close
here okay and after this TR I also want
to start another TR
here okay so that I can put them into
the another level now so under this TR I
can use this TD now so after this
minus after
456 minus once again I would like to
start another table row here
okay so that it has go to the next row
so
here after TD we're closing this tier
and starting another tier
now okay we're starting another TR after
that we talk about
789 okay
plus see here talking about 789 Plus
here the table is getting closed and it
is starting right now like
this see that looks better now okay but
still few more things which I would like
to make it even more organized but
that's not a problem we will do it
little later on okay because you can see
eight is missing right now so
here seven me copy
this equal to
8 8
yeah that looks better now so now they
are basically completely organized so
the moment I expect my application so we
will call Dot here then zero then equal
to and then we will call
multiplication okay so looks better now
now I just would like to perform the
overall look and feel so I need to go
ahead and use what CSS because without
CSS I really can't utilize this in a
proper way so have to start working with
the CSS front now in CSS front how to
start first we will go back to my code
and here in my CSS we'll start working
with font family but before font family
I would like to start with the body part
now
body background color I'm using C
T that looks nice okay
so I will be using this app. CSS in my
HTML to see the look how it is being
appeared right now so in my index.html
file on the top under my head
section
link sty
sheet
okay now see it looks better now going
forward in my CSS we want to use some H1
color tool so
here we would like to use the
H1 text
align
Center
color white margin top
margin top we would like to use 50
pixels this is for H1 let's
check perfect so it is now coming in
between next statement will be call
screen so we say
dot screen so in this screen we use the
background
color background color
gray and after that
border
sorry border
solid black and two
pixels after that
color white font
size
medium next width
we're using this
100% then we talk about
cursor will be say what are the default
cursor
is okay then
padding we would like to say 10
pixels and then
margin say
Auto the then margin
bottom that I'll be using 10
pixels so is the proper
alignment
okay look that's how exactly we want
that's for a screen where the exact
outcome will be visible to me and rest
of the details we'll be showing you one
by one now we'll be talking about called
input okay
input
type equal to button for input type
equal to
button okay input to button of type
what over the over on button I
say background color change to
what I can
say right
smoke okay and uh when the button is
active what I want let me
copy input button and here I say
active and this color should be orange
red like this you can see now how it is
basically looking like
it okay active the color will be like
this okay I'll be talking about called
operators operator should behave
different so I'm saying
dot
operator in this operator we are saying
background
color background color
orange okay then
ping I want five pixels
okay then I want
color that should be
black after this I'm using call
border
sorry that border I'm using this called
solid and then
black
and
after this
withd I'm using
100% then
height height we using 40
pixels then
cursor it has to be pointer
Tye okay that's it let's
check perfect so they should turn back
to what to your orange color and uh you
can see the moment I take my cursor on
turns to White perfect and now those who
are type number I also want to change
them so for
number for number I want to say the same
option fting I want five
pixels then I need height
of typ 40
pixels then I say
color it looks I want to say called
black then
border border I want
solid black and two pixes
solid black and two pixels then width
I would say point withd I would say
100% And
cursor once again point that is for
number let's check awesome so they looks
nice now we left with few other type of
options like in do and equal to okay
that I'm talking called decimal for
decimal I need to have a different
options with me okay so let me try to
copy
this paste it and I say
for deci so for decimal background color
will
be light blue padding 5 pixels color
black border
solid okay black two pixels with 100%
height 40 pixels F cursor pointer
perfect okay looks nice but I have
changed the color to light blue now
now I talk about
clear okay now come back and
say clear okay in this color background
color is I'm changed to light
salmon light salmon padding five pixels
color black border same withth 100%
height 40 pixels fine so cursor pointer
find
margin Auto and margin
bottom margin
bottom let's
check perfect not looks
beautiful okay now here after giving
this details we talking about called
equal part do equal so for do equal also
I'm just copying the
same so we a call background color
adding
color just change
to light
green light GRE and
uh after this since it is a equal so we
say padding five pixels is okay color
black fine border fine WID 100% height
40
pixels color and cursor pointers just I
don't need to it's for to equal and I
want for
container container in this container
width I want 40%
with 40% background color
white okay now here pting is 15
pixels so display
block
so first of all we have call width we
say display block which we taking
margin okay in margin we say 100
pixels
a okay now align
cells equal to
Center okay border
radius border radius which is say 10
pixels okay now we seeing box
shadow box Shadow five
pixels
black and
pading so these are the details I have
it now okay we have it background color
we are taking it now align cell display
block water radius padding and padding
15 pixels we've given already I don't
need to give it again margin okay fine
walk Shad let's
try awesome so it's looking beautiful
now okay so this where exactly my
application works like that and table
when we talk
about here we saying
width
100%
okay that's
it
super so it's now giving me the proper
look of how my application should behave
like it just see about the container
what we have done with 40% we taking
background
color let's bring it below then align
self display block okay
margin okay and uh border
radius and uh fine so I think we all
good now so that's it so we'll try and
implement JavaScript part well everyone
so our CSS file is ready our HTML is
ready it's time to just uh go ahead and
talk about my final portion that is
called GS part where I want to basically
perform some
calculators now here I just say function
display function display which takes Val
as an parameter and say document do get
element by ID here I'm
saying result okay
dot
value okay plus equal
to whatever be adding it just it
basically try to apply calculation on
the top of
that okay there is the function after
that we have another functions available
here called function
solve here in the
solve we just use a value called let x
equal
to document do get by ID
result okay
dot value
sorry dot
Valu okay and say let
y equal to perform the calculations for
be using one function called EV and type
X as in
parameter now the next statement will be
again document
dot get by
ID result
Dot
value equal
y okay now later on I'll like to use
another function here
function
clear
screen and here we say
document. by ID here we
see result
dot value equal to like that so clear
screen Sol and display three functions
are associated with me and these three
functions are the part of this
Javascript file which I'll be calling it
at the end before the mod get closed so
here
script equal to
F do
J that's it okay let's try to execute
now
here two you can see the values I will
say +
6 = to 8 absolute say see is clear the
screen 6
/
2 equal to 3 awesome so friends your
calculator application is ready
congratulations to all so it is a very
simplest form which we have developed
this is your HTML which is a template
for you this is a CSS which is your
complete the area of like how the look
and feel will look like in of this
template beautification and here last we
have got GS which is smaller logic but
really meaningful hello everyone and uh
welcome back so this time we're going to
talk about our next very interesting
feature that is know as called dealing
with another example that is called
snake game so snake game is one of the
very very powerful example which I'm
going to share with you which will help
you to understand like how we offer a
very simplest way of developing a mini
project okay that is something which is
a snake game let's see how the snake
game is important and how we going to
deal with this these are our previous
examples which we have seen which I will
call a project which we have created at
is called quiz application and now we're
going to start working with our new
project now here first of all I'm going
to create a new folder that is called
snake game and inside this is snake game
we need some new folders uh first folder
I'm going to create it inside this that
is called
images and uh within this is snake games
I'm going to create few new files that
is called
index.html
and uh here I'm going to create a new
file name called
app.js at the same time I'll be having
some of the CSS files if I need so I can
say app do CSS so total number of three
files I have it now let me close down
all the files whichever I have opened it
earlier so now that looks cleaner
approach so this is a snake game for for
us from where we need to start and uh we
have a called index.html file and here I
will as usual
create our basic HTML syntax and uh here
I would like to
include our script
tag
script SRC equal to
app.js that's it and now going forward
we will start developing our next
implementation of snake
ging now inside my body tag I would like
to have some basic property called
speed okay and uh later on I'll be
taking the input from the client so we
saying input type equal
to so here we can justify the speed and
we can give ID equal to
game
speed and followed by
value equal to we can give the value
called five initial value and Min equal
to 1 that is the minimum value and Max
equal to 9 that is the maximum and
minimum value we can offer beyond that I
won't allow the users to go and step
that means the increment value that is
one well that is the input type and now
another input we are taking
input type equal
to button and uh value equal to start
and then ID equal
to game
start okay so we're giving this values
after
that I can give some
braks so two braks we giving it and
start working with the div tag now and
in this div tag I'll be using the
canvas it is a HTML 5
feature we use canvas and I just give ID
equal
to game
area there is a canvas and uh after this
canvas we
will that div tag is closed here after
the div tag I can use another div tag
div here I can say class equal
to I may not have any class written but
I can say class equal to relative so
later on if I want to apply any CSS
style I can certainly apply and and
after that I can offer the
images okay so I may not have any images
right now so I just leave this image
blank right
now okay and this script SRC I'll load
it only before my body tag get closed it
is always a good practice to keeping
this script tag on a bottom of the body
tag always designed for good practice
now this is almost ready for me let me
check
okay so I can see
values now it will go maximum 9 that is
how we have given and minimum is one
start is the button which not doing
anything but later on we can allow some
logic inside this now we have to start
working with our main JavaScript tag
this is my app.js and here onwards we
will use some of the properties okay
which I want to initialize it so we
saying
V game
start equal to n initialized second game
speed equal to n next game
area equal to
null Game Area
context
equal to
null then Game Area
width Game Area
width equal to zero that is integer
value Game Area
height game
area equal to zero again
then cell
width cell WID equal to
Z play
score equal to 0er
again next
snake equal to
null next snake
food equal to
null
next snake
Direction equal to
null snake speed or else I can say speed
size speed
size equal to
zero next we have a call
timer equal
to so these number of properties we have
initialized okay now after that we will
be writing a function by saying function
name is called
initialize okay and here in initialized
we would like to use some of the
properties first we are saying game
start equal
to document
dot get element by ID here I can give
the value called
hash game start let me put it in double
quotes
again
start now game speed now these are all
basically the values are there game
start game speed these all values we
have to take it okay so we will be
seeing these values one by one so let me
say that another one that is called game
Speed game speed equal to again document
dot get element by ID now we are
passing the game Speed
game game speed
now here once again I take another point
game
area I say
game game area here you have to give the
value called game game
area Okay so these values we have taken
now we'll be talking about called Game
Area
context Game Area context equal
to Game
Area dot git
context
get and in this gain context we'll be
using what type of context using
2D okay because I want to have the kind
of 2D so this is how the kind of
environment we want to set next we talk
about Game Area
width equal to just initialize to 400
next game area height equal to
600 now cell with
we're initializing with
20 next game area do
width okay so Game Area
dot width equal
to Game Area
width and then we Define game area.
height
Dot
equal
to Game Area
height so these are the values we
initializing this okay now after that we
have to start writing the logic here I'm
saying game
start game start dot now we have to line
which event you would like to take so I
will say on
click on click click so when I basically
click what should happen so on click
equal
to
function so what you want to write it
here I'm saying this
dot this do disabled equal to true so I
want to disable these values and after
that we want to call another function
inside this but which function let's do
that so here we have is saying
function start
game
start game and uh here in start game we
want to Define the initial score see the
initial score for the player will be
certainly zero so we say
player score equal
to0 after that direction in which
direction you want a snake to move so we
are saying snake Direction
equal to
right in the right direction then speed
size the value sorry the variable which
we have defined so speed size equal to
because it'll be accepting the value
from the text boxes or from the drop
down so it certainly will be string type
so we have to use
parcent so we using this option called
parcent and here we are
using game speed Dot
value okay so we using this value game
speed. value now here we would like to
calculate certain things what those are
first we are saying
if okay what if
condition uh see this function we are
writing called start game because there
are certain things which you need to
make it so like that we have to Define
it so function initialize
we have
started okay and then after that we have
written on click within this so this is
what the on click we had and there
onwards we have to finish this
point and after that we've started start
game and now we'll be writing the logic
for this so here we are saying if we
saying speed size we're saying if a
speed size greater than
9 in case if it is the value uses
hardcoded it then we would like to write
a logic here and what this logic would
be it says if it is greater than 9 we
say speed
size equal to
9 we basically initialize to what 9 here
we say
LF is speed
size
is
zero we say speed
size
sorry speed size equal to one that means
if it is less than zero I'll be making
it minimum to 1 if it is greater than 9
I'll be making it to 9 maximum and
that's
it okay so after this lcf condition is
getting closed we are seeing speed size
equal to one so here we just say
snake snake equal to array so that is my
array for me and after that we are
saying
snake dot push because it needs to move
ahead and here we'll be pushing it
towards by saying X position
zero and then
the
Y and here the Y value will be what C
that means how far it can go so with it
will go within the width of this
application okay so that's how exactly
we would like to make
it okay so here we have a call cell
width which we have given here after
that what we have to do is we have to
Define our own function called clear
interval and this clear interval perform
any logic whichever I would like to make
it okay so here after that snake. push
value has been given here I will be
creating one more function here that
known as called uh create food okay so
here we're saying
create food so create food will be the
function for me now you might be
thinking where this function is but this
function will be declared soon within
your application but here first we are
seeing the function called clear
interval clear interval with a
timer okay whatever the timer we'll be
passing it and after that this clear
interval will be saying timer equal
to set
interval with this we saying create Game
Area
create
now here in our application whatever the
value we are giving it that we need to
basically Implement so here we are
giving this called create food is a
function we calling after that we
calling this clear interval clear
interval will be just like in a typical
function which is there after that we
are using this option called create game
area so this will be available to me on
which the value will be taken that okay
and then we will be telling you how you
can call this function create food and
how to create it first well so we are
talking about a functionality called
create game interval so this create game
timer is the one which we have to create
it by our own so this function which we
passing it after the saying set interval
this function is not it there so we have
to basically go back and create this
function within my
application fine so what we will do is
just this particular one we will try to
comment it for a time being okay so here
we have a call what create interval in
this create interval we'll be passing
any parameters which we have passed as a
what as a timer here and here we calling
this called create food so here after
that we'll be calling this function
called create food so let's go and say
function create
food and this function create food let's
go and write a logic here
and what logic we want to write it in a
create food we say snake
food snake food equal
to and here in our curly bases we use
two Direction X and Y we say in X we say
math
dot round and inside this we
say math
Dot
random after this math. random function
we have to just take this calculation
and check the another parameter called
Game Area
width Game Area width
minus cell width the one which you're
passing it and here after that we'll be
performing the calculation by
saying
C okay so this is for our x coordinate s
way we would like to use for my y
coordinate
also now math do round round. number
Game Area Game Area height but here
rather than using width we'll be using
height minus C let me give some
space divided by cell
width okay so that's where exactly it's
got
closed okay now here our applications is
now ready by calling the function called
create food like that we'll be going to
create another function called create
game area let me go and create all the
functions first so we are saying
function create Game Area create
Game Area there is another function for
me after this create game area here
there will be another function I'm going
to create it that is called
Control Function
control okay after that we'll go to
write one more function called
function right
score there's another function available
for us control we have a call right
score there's another function which
you're going to write it down here that
is called
function right score is done now we say
create Square
create Square this is another function
and finally we'll have a call change
direction
function
change change
direction so that's it so these many
functions we wanted to create it here in
our system well we know it very well
that we have taken this called create
food create food function is already
ready now now we're going to talk about
our next function called create game
area and in this create game area we are
defining two locations where X Direction
and Y Direction so we
say uh a
snake x equal
to snake the position we are taking is
called zero and we saying dot X for the
X direction we are saying
V
snake y equal to snake position we are
taking once again
zero and Dot y so two directions we have
taken X Direction and Y Direction now
here we are starting
game area context
dot fill style that you know it very
well it is a property fill style equal
to which color you want to fill this up
so I'm saying hash white
color okay and then we using this game
area context again do fill
react fill
react now keep the position values I'm
saying zero comma 0 comma Game Area
width Game Area width comma Game Area
height so we are basically filling the
values with color we want to use it
called Stoke style let me take this game
area context
again dot stock
style stock style equal to now we give
the another color here by saying
hash okay and then the next option
called same G me context do stroke
react
stroke react and here we pass the values
again 0 comma 0 comma Game Area
width
comma
gain area
height so we passing those values like
that and now after this we have to write
a logic of the directions now see the
when you talk about snake game it move
left right and Center up and down so now
in this case we have to increment the
situations according so we say if the
snake
direction if the snake
direction
to
right then we say
snake
x++ now L
if
LF same let's copy
this snake
Direction left
then what should happen here we
say
snake
x minus
minus okay so we're taking like that let
me copy this
again now
here here we're taking about left right
we say
down so in this case we say
snake Y
++ and in this case if it is up then we
say
snake Yus
minus so these conditions we are taking
it now now here after this lse if
condition we would like to take another
if condition now here in my if condition
we are using some more lengthy
statements what's that we say if snake
X if snakes
x minus
one
or snake
x dou equal
to Game Area width which we have taken
divided by cell width
okay
or we are taking this condition called
snake
y snake y equal
to -
[Music]
one okay so we giv this call minus one
or snake
y snake y equal
to gain area
height to S
it
or here we will take the another
condition
here yeah we will take the another
condition here call we will have another
function called
control which we have created it some
time back and inside is control
it will take some parameters so what
those parameters we can pass we can say
a snake X
comma snake y comma third parameter will
be
snake so this would be my another
function okay so here we are passing the
conditions just like
that
okay now here this is available to me a
parenthesis and here we're writing the
situation for right score which is so
far the function is only created not
described more so we writing the right
score the score will be written here and
here we seeing clear
interval because the timer will be
stopped
okay and you're saying game
start
dot disabled equal
to
false and after that
return that's it so this is the logic
for we have written to this particular
example now we can use another if more
conditions here just to check the
behavior of my code if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know
more well here we have finished till
this game start do disable equal to
false and we returned now going forward
after this return We would like to have
another condition for the snake X so we
say if snake
X if
snake x equal
to S snake
food.
X okay snake food. x m
% snake
y equal to snake food dot y then in this
case I will say War new head
V new head
sorry V new head equal to here x
colon snake
X Y col snake
y snake X and Y
colum snake y
these options we are taking
it now after that we using this option
called player
score plus equal to speed
size and then we are
calling create food method
again and here after that we're using
the else
condition and in this else condition we
are saying V
new
head equal
to
snake dot
pop okay and we are saying new
head. x equal to snake
X and new
head dot y equal
to snake
y so these value are basically
associating with your heads and after
that we are saying snake Dot
unshift
unshift snake. unshift and here we are
passing this option called new
head that's it and after that we'll be
starting with our for Loop by by saying
for VAR equal to VAR
I I equal to
0 then I is less than snake
dot
length and
uh snake do length and once
i++ okay later on we just use the option
called
create a square and in this create
Square we are
passing
snake snake position
I dot X comma
same
snake
y That's it so it's getting closed here
and after that we are calling the same
option with this snake foot let me copy
this
again and here rather than using this we
can say snake food.
X and snake food. y
okay so now this values has been added
into my code now we start working with
your control control needs to take three
parameters x y and the array so we are
passing this option call control and in
this control we are taking X comma y
comma array three parameters we are
taking it later on we are using this
option called for
v i = to z i is less
than array
dot length and I ++ and after that we'll
be using this option called if condition
and here we
say
array I which value we passing do
x equal to X m%
m% here we say
array with a position called
I and in this we are saying do y and
this position we are checking for the Y
condition for the Y condition so it
Returns what
true return
true the condition
okay that is for if condition else
return
one
false now that's it now we are talking
about this option name called right
score this right score we have to use
the game area
context Game Area context
dot
font equal to here we'll be passing the
situation we saying 50
pixels 50 pixels and then
s
hyph
Serv after that we using called Game
Area context again let me copy
this take it again called Game Area
context
dot fill style equal to here I'll be
using the another color now so we say
hash
okay now after that we are saying once
again the game area context
dot fill
text here we are
saying
score
colum and here we say
plus player score whatever it is with
Game Area
width
Game Area
width Slash 2
minus 100 and then again G area
width slash2 so this is where exactly
the right score where the data will be
actually
written okay next we'll be having this
option called create square and this
create Square it takes two parameters
one we're talking about called X second
is is taking Y and now here we're using
this game area
context same
dot fill style equal to let me give the
color after this we're using call same G
and text Game Area text
Dot fill react here we are saying X
multiply
by cell width comma
y multi
by cell withd
comma cellwidth
comma cell withd this is what my gr
square is now we are left with only one
option that is know called change
direction it's time to figure out this
last function called change direction
which takes one parameter called e
typically we talk about
for parameters now here we passing this
option called War Keys equal to e
Dot and later on we want to say
if
Keys equal
to
40 okay m% m%
is snake
Direction equal
to
up okay so here we
say snake Direction equal
to down so we changing the directions
here okay now let me try to copy
this and here we use
[Music]
elsf four
times okay so here we talk this 30 40
and here we say
39 and followed by
38 followed by
37 39 38 37
and here we say up let's change to what
left
down right here we
say
right
up left the three options we have
changed and last but not least here I'll
just
use window Dot
on key down equal
to change
directions
and window do
onload okay equal
to initialize that's how exactly we want
to use now and this function what we
have defined in
initialize okay so in this initialize we
are having this game start do on click
and and all so you have a called start
game now this start game will be calling
it
here okay so in
start we have a call snake we have call
snake. push and after that we are
calling this function called what create
food clear interval and here we say tyer
equal to here set clear interval and
here
change game
area
slash speed
size that's you want to use it okay
everyone so our code is almost ready so
we have this complete JavaScript code
ready with me now it's time to basically
use within my HTML just to check how it
may behave so in my HTML page I have
written this uh normal speed number game
speed value button start we will call
game start after that we have a call
canvas where we return ID equal to call
Game Area Dev class equal to relative
and
uh that's it and here we have a call
script SRC equal to
app.js so that's it what we have written
now finally we would like to see how it
may look if I try to use in my browser
let me try to refresh
okay I really do not see any changes in
my
code okay um despite I'm having this
because the CSS content is actually
missing okay because then only my code
will look better because if there is no
CSS it wouldn't really make good towards
my
application okay and I also want to have
certain images but those images we will
take it a little later on let me go back
and try to bring CSS into this picture
now so first of
all have this U index.html file with me
and here I want to use CSS so inside my
head tag we want to
use Link
Ariel equal
to style cheet
okay
HF equal
to app do
CSS okay now here in my CSS we want to
offer certain details what those details
I want to start working with I will
start with my body
part
body so we want to offer the font family
so font family maybe little bit later on
I can use it first I want to use
margin margin 20
pixels
Auto later
text
align
Center next font
size
font size 150 pixels I'll say
150% and uh here we want to say
background background image since I do
not have any image so I will just leave
it as a
blank okay so just otherwise I have to
say
URL and inser this URL give some values
but I leave it as a black because I do
not have any image I will say background
color this back back color I can just
use
white after that
height I can just say 800
pixels after that background
position background position I want to
use
Center then background
repeat background repeat I want no
repeat
then background
size
col okay let's see if there's a effect
in
my okay I see it's now in the middle
better now inputs canvas we have to
basically take that here we talk about
called
input okay in this input I say font size
font size may be optional I can make
it but let me say font size
100
percent then text
align
Center then
padding I want to say five
pixels
and 7
pixels okay looks better now well here
after that I can use
canvas in this canvas I want to say the
background
color I just say
white after that border
radius border radius I can say 20
pixels
then Shadow if I want to use it so I
just say box
shadow box Shadow I can say three
pixels 5
pixels and 6
pixels and the color
is
black let's
check awesome so I can see here uh the
logic is there so Shadow you can easily
see how has been using and uh that's it
and this D I can say d
dot
relative
position
absolute
top here I'm saying using 760 pixels
left 120
pixels that's
it so this is where exactly I program
now when I say
start okay so there may be some error
here this it cannot set a property of
call on click null so just we can just
check this into this uh gamar Doon
click let's
check anyways we just try to fix it
issue in uh while but anyways we have
our created CSS and now going forward
we'll be implementing rest of the logic
within my code okay everyone so we have
changed some names here because there
was some value was mismatch so we have
basically changed those values with your
properties and now when I try to
relaunch my
application by uh
this index.html
file so now in my index.html file when I
try to add so it's just as usual see let
me say start and here you can see game
start when I go up you see like it's
starting right now okay isn't this an
amazing game right now
friends okay that is the same game what
you used to play it earlier okay but you
can just change the direction go up and
you can see the score T is being placed
here that's it so this is where exactly
the look and feel of your game has been
taken and uh you can just increase the
speed suppose if you just put a value
called what zero it by default set
whatever value you want to take it with
a start now you can see based on that
the speed can be justified and the
example can be
developed okay you can see the start
button is disabled because right now the
user is still going on unless the user
game is finished this one is not going
to work fine so like that you can see
and automatically this will be position
this is know called food that is how we
have used it my example on called app.js
you can see we using this example name
called food create food so create food
of the specific interval time this will
be automatically created and the snake
will eat and increase the size of the
code okay that's it and now the CSS has
been given if you want to add certain
image certainly you can add it otherwise
this is the first game which we can see
how it is running and giving you the
better example so if you also want to
become a successful software developer
and gain handsome salary packages then
look at the wide range of software
development courses by simply learn in
collaboration with the top universities
across the globe by enrolling in any of
these certification programs you will
Master modern coding techniques with
boot camp level intensity becoming a
fulltech technologist these program lays
the foundation for crafting full stack
web applications so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll now a year of
experience is preferred to enroll in
these courses so check out the link
mentioned in the description box below
for more details friends welcome and now
we are planning to develop one very
special game for you in JavaScript
because we have already seen our
previous projects as like an I say quiz
game as well as the Snake Game both are
working fantastically and now it's time
to talk about another very interesting
game that is known as called Tic Tac Tic
Tac 2 is world's favorite game we have
already played a lot in our Childhood
Days and still my favorite game so I
have decided to basically offer you this
Tic Tac to game developed in JavaScript
HTML plus CSS which can create something
really really great effects for the end
users so let's go and start developing
our next game that's called te Taco so
in this Tech Taco I will start working
with this creating a folder called Tik
Tac and inside this I'm going to create
a new file name called
index.htm now here here onwards the same
thing I'll be creating this HTML tags
and now here
onwards we want our some classes for
headers and footer but so we're going to
create some D tag now so in this div
tag I'll be creating some of the
tags in which the CSS class will be
applied so we just going to create a
classes uh sorry we going to just use
those classes but we'll create it later
on so just go ahead and create those so
we saying
D okay so now this point onwards is my
first div tag inside this I'll keep my
H1 tag and under this H1 I will be
offering some of the headings which will
be useful to contain some necessary
information with regards to this game so
div here we say
H1 and uh inside this H1 it give the
message call class equal to
header and here I'll give the name
called is a Tic Tac token after this div
class yeah here we will start working
with our form
tag within my form tag I will start my
div after div tag I will use label
so label for player
one or else I can say player one and
inside this let's give the name called
player label is closed and U after this
label we'll start working with our input
tag
input now in this input what are the
data I need first I need called type
equal
to text number one
second placeholder equal to ENT
name next name equal to player
one next we want ID equal
to player one and then any class if I
want to apply anyways we're going to
close
this is my first text box and um same
thing I would like to create for my
another one so the first D tag we have
used let me go and create another div
tag in this div tag I'll use the same
label copy the
same paste it it here and this is for
player
two
so we have this two players with me and
after this D tag I offer the submit
button
now input I to
submit start
game now the form tag is closed here div
tag is also closed so you want the div
tag to be closed before that it's up to
you now so here we have a called div
class whichever we have taken so if you
want you can basically put it later or
before whatever so we have basically
form tag with us so form tag is there
later on you can just show some
containers where the details will be
visible to me so here after the form tag
let me try to offer but first check
check whether it's really working fine
so
here yeah we have this option called ENT
name ENT name after the stick T
to
so yeah so here the details we have
taken input up text and input up
text okay so two values we are taking
now and accordingly we will go ahead now
finally after the form tag we would like
to start with working with the T tag
again div and inside this div since I
haven't created any CSS classes so those
we can use it little later on but let's
have this div and insert this div I
would like to use one more D
type okay and here we want to use one
more div
tag
so inside this div we will be using one
more div
tag so in this div we can just give the
value called Data ID equal to
zero ID equal to Z it's just the value
we're passing
it div data equal to zero the div tag is
getting closed
fine so that's how we want it now so
here the first D tag is closed like that
we can create another data ID so 0 1 2
total number of three we want to create
it so I want to create 0 1 2 345 like
this so the way we have created here for
this div let's go and create one more
div
tag ID equal to
one
two three options we have it
now okay like that I can keep on
creating the others also
two
3
4 five so 0 1 2 3 4 5 total number of
five we have created one more I would
like to create it now here for
six there'll be no difference because we
haven't changed anything here okay so
the div tag is getting closed
here okay and uh that's it and uh if you
want to create some clear board or
button that you can basically offer it a
little later on but here we can use one
more
d
and here we say
d d class equal to relative and within
this D tag I can use any image tag if I
want so I just leave it as it is and
after this I can create one more D
TP and inser this another
T okay and uh under this I'm going to
create a
button okay and in this button we'll be
having some value okay we can SEC the
value name call
replay this button is created and now we
can create a clear clear
board
spam and here is a clear
board that's
it okay so
here is
just a small game I want to develop
it better now this no user interface has
been used so this user interface will be
using it later on by offering them a
pure look and feel so that you know it
gives me more better look when your
application will start but most
importantly I need to start working with
the JavaScript part where the logic will
get calculated
here okay so we want to start with the
JavaScript so let's get included the
JavaScript with my code so
here
I can say here script
tag
script equal
to now the file I haven't created so let
it be as it
is that's it so this is my script tag
and let me try to include my style sheet
also so I just
say
link AR style
shade and give the name called app do
CSS though I haven't created but I'm
giving
it
okay that's
it so we have taken this HTML into our
consideration now we'll be creating this
CSS as well as the JavaScript to make
this example complete
well we are ready with our HTML now it's
time to basically go back and spend time
on our JavaScript so we're going to
create a new file now with the name
called
app.js and inside this we will start
writing the logic with our main
application okay now the first thing is
how we going to start now yeah so first
thing what we need to do is we need to
attach
window
dot add event listener and when the
window will load some logic should
happen so I'm saying
load second is the name of the function
so the name of the function perhaps does
not exist but I can give the name called
app which I'm going to create it shortly
now here first of all let me try to
create a game board I'm saying
let game
board equal to now let me have some of
the values because it is 8 digit so we
just make
it like that and one
more for making it
n okay so that's how we're going to
create it
now okay now the is all empty right now
after that we're going to create
lit
turn just a new variable equal to Zer
what this is it keep tracking if x or
zero player it s like which player turns
it to be so just it is trying to mention
it I'm saying
let winner equal to
false okay now let's go and create the
player so
so
create player how do you go to create a
player you say
const player equal to what we going to
pass name okay equal
to now inside this we can say name equal
to name next we say
return
name that's it okay after that I'm
defining
l
l x equal
to CER with the empty
value and
again player
y equal to player is an empty value now
let's try to initialize the
app okay
initialize the app now inside this
initialize the app we're going to create
a new
function function
app and inside this we're going to
create a variable like by saying
let input
feed equal to first of all document do
get element by ID here we're going to
take the class name of this particular
text field so we are saying input
hyphen
field okay
dot
Focus okay now after this we have to say
const add
players equal to once
again
document do get element by ID we will
just give the name called player
form okay next we saying
add
player okay
dot add event listener we want to attach
to the event on which
event submit event and what
logic
add
players okay after that once the players
are added we are saying let
replay replay button equal to once
again document sorry yeah document do
get El by ID or rather I will say
document. quy
selector document. query
selector
replay
BT okay to just the name we basically
taking that and here we
say
sorry replay button dot add event
listener which EV I want to
say
click okay that is the first event
second reset
B reset
B that we basically passing
out okay now this is the initial case
which we have it now beyond that I will
add this is the Players what we have
added right N Slides to add the players
so this is how we have initialized after
that let's
add players how to basically add the
players here we have to just Define the
function
add players okay we take event as a
parameter and say
event
do
prevent
prevent default this prevent default
will try to prevent the
default uh you know Behavior which is
submitting to be get avoided and now
here we say
if this
dot player one so we just Define the
property called player
one if this dot player one dot
what
value
okay is
blank okay
or
this day two
sorry this do player
two now I just want to find it out its
value
also
value black then what I should do in
this case I'm saying
alert
you
must enter the name for
each field the user has to add the
values and after that
return okay now the next thing is like
we would like to select the players in
the inside is by saying
const
player
form
container again const player from
container container equal to document
dot query
selector document query selector here we
will just pass the value called
enter
hyon
players okay now we say
con board main equal
to document dot once
again query
selector
ccore
M okay after
that clear form container dot class
list dot class list do add here we
giving the name called what height
container
heighton
container and after that
just say board
main board main do
classlist
dot
remove hide hyphen
table okay so we have basically taken
that and after this what I will do I'll
just say
player X do name equal to
this
dot player one
dot value okay this for player x copy
this player
y two and after
that that's it so we have done it now
so we'll be calling other functions one
by one but that is the first thing which
we have
implemented well so add player function
is added right now and uh after this add
player we have to basically call one
more that is called which Returns the
current player so I'm saying
return current
player and here what I will do is we'll
just write
function and here we
say
current player and in this current
player what we will do is we will say
return
turn just
variable okay
percentile two we're just adding it with
this
zero okay if it
is then X turn I'm telling you okay or
else
so weing like the current player who
says the current player right now well
after this adding the return current
player we're going to add the another
function that is know as called return
the current player return current player
is having this value and after that we
need to say resize the square in event
browser is resized once again if the
browser is getting resized automatically
the square size of your Tic Tac to
should also get increased so we just
say
resize
squares and here we going to say this
option equal
window
dot add event
listener now we have a call option
called resize here and the second
parameter what we passing is called
on
resize okay on
resize now let's try to add
it after this we are writing this
function
called function
on resize that is the function name for
me the one which you're passing into the
second
parameter we saying let all
sales equal
to
document dot query selector
all in this we are
passing
board
underscore
sell okay and then we're using another
option called what
let cell
height equal to all
cells with the
position okay dot of set width of set
width after that we are saying all
cells dot for each here we are
passing cell
[Music]
and after that we are using cell
dot style
dot height equal to now he'll be using
this back tick and use this dollar sign
and
say
cell height and that to in a pixel so
this will be taking the dynamic
values okay that's it that's it
now we have to just launch our
billboard now
billboard
build board so how we going to build our
board now for this we are saying
function build
port and inside this billboard we will
see just option called
let reset
container equal
to document dot once again query
selector and pass the value called dot
reset okay and after that we are saying
reset container dot class
list do
remove and we are passing the value
called
reset
Hy hiden this value and after that we
may call some other type of functions
also okay so for those functions I can
say first will be called
on
resize after that we are calling add
celf click
listener but but I do not have that
function with me these functions we need
to create it by our own okay so we will
just leave those for a time being let's
go back and create another functions now
so we just want to write another event
with cellclick event for play to attempt
to make move so here we trying to
say
sell
click
event
for player
two
attempt to make
move now this function we to create it
so we just say function
now we just say function and give the
name of the function to make move Now
function make move it
takes event as an
parameter and here we have saying
[Music]
console.log and say
turn now let's go back and try to check
the another condition that is called
let current
cell equal
to parent because we have to read the
value from there and here we are saying
what event
dot current Target
sorry even dot current Target
DOT first element
child okay
dot data
set do
ID so we're reading this values after
that we use another variable called
it cell
to
add token now here we are typing
document dot query
selector and here in I using backtick
I'm using this value
called Data hyph
ID okay equal
to here we using
once again in a single
quotes
dollar current
cell okay so this value we are taking it
like that after that we're using this
situation called
if sell to add token
dot inner
HTML exet mark
blank once again if sell to add token in
HTM equal to blank then what next so
sell to add token dot inner
HTM equal to blank then what you should
do I'm saying
console DOT log and give the value the
one which you
want
okay so in this console.log what value
we can give it sell to add
token we have it it is taking this value
to the current cell do inner HTML
console. log and inside my console.log
we can set
this cell
is already
taken so values are already taken for
this and now we will be returning those
values after that we will be using else
condition and here we use once again
if current
player
okay is
X then we'll be using this option
called
sell see we have this property of option
available called sell to add token so we
saying sell to add token okay
dot text content equal
to current
player okay and we say game board the
one which you have created pass in this
game board this value
called current cell and in this current
cell value will be equal to
X okay
else we can
say sell to add token
dot text content equal
to current
player okay and say game
board
current
cell equal
to like
this okay so here we are adding the
values like
that so it is closed after that we can
just use the function name called is
winner to check whether the user is
winner or not so we are saying
is
winner okay and uh after that we are
saying
Turn
Plus+ after that we are
saying change we do not have the
function name called change board header
names okay so it's just like that we're
giving it so as usual we can leave this
function for a time being and uh we'll
call this little later on so leave it as
up for a time
being okay so your function is now ready
so the next thing what we need to check
whether it is Ty or not okay so we are
saying
function
check
if
I we just checking the function whether
is game is TI or not so here we say if
the condition is
turn greater than
seven alert
game
over okay we can say give over or we can
say a
time okay well after that we are saying
winner
function is
winner now what we will check is we will
check con
winning
sequences winning sequences and here
sorry here we are having this array and
having the different conditions
Associated we say 0 1 2 probability we
are checking it and then I just copy
it
well we saying 012 and here we saying 3
4
5
6
7
8 and 03 6
again 0
3
6 and once again
147 4
7 and next we have a call
258
8 then we are checking the valal
048 8 and one more last option we'll put
isal
246 six so these conditions we are
adding it now after this array we can
say
say winning sequences
do for
each and give the name called winning
comos
winning
comos and inside this winning compos we
giving
lit cell one equal
to winning combos position
zero then
that
copy and uh P three
times cell
two cell three and here we get the value
called what one two s Val we're giving
it and after that we're checking the
condition let's
say
if and here the conditions you're
checking what exactly that will be for
the game board we
saying game
board S
one current
player sorry current
player m%
m% come
down game
carde c
to just copy this the same line and
paste it multiple times now
here we're checking the condition for
cell 2 and cell
3 and uh cell three and uh after
that we starting the position so after
that we starting the position
[Music]
call by cting this condition call Con CS
con Cs and then equal to document do get
element by or sorry document. query
selector query selector all and here
let's select the position
dot Board
uncore
sell okay then after that we will be
using
CS
dot for
each
cell and inside is what we passing we
saying
let cell ID equal
to cell
do first element
child okay dot
data set do ID so this is the value
which we basically adding it now and
we're using one more if condition we're
saying
if Cell
ID now we're talking about called cell
ID triple equal
to cell
one
or cell
ID cell
two
or cell ID equal
to cell
3 okay and in that case we can use cell
do class
list do add get the name called
board just give the class
name
winner so here we'll be giving the
winner and apart of that we can use the
other conditions
too okay so here it is adding the value
and now let's say
let current player equal
to document Dot
get element by ID so you can basically
Define it so current player you want so
we can use the current player or
whichever conditions you want so here we
use what the cell winner now Small
Change rather than using current player
we can use the current player
text the new variable we are creating it
current player text document dot rather
than saying get by ID we can say query
selector
and in this query selector we'll be
giving the value by saying dot
board
player hyphen
turn the value which we given it here in
that query
selected value whichever you given this
let me try to put it in
a
parenthesis like
this okay now here we just check if
current
player
X then what then in this case we can
say current player whatever the value we
are using current player text
Dot inner
HTML equal to now we can Define the
value whichever we want to operate we
just use a condition called
div class equal
to okay so we saying
congratulations okay and here we
say congratulations along with
dollar
sign and here we
pass player y
dot
name and here the DP type is getting
closed like
this okay so that's the message we are
basically printing it and after that we
give this value
and say this message
called winner equal to
true and after
that if you want to
apply remove that function we haven't
written we'll be talking about a little
later on and just say return
true so your function is ready now and
later on we can just check the condition
if if
Winer
if
winner or we can
say check if
I and return
false that's
it now in a continuation to this example
we going to develop another function
which the name is called change board
header names so let's continue by
defining the new function called
function
change
change board header
names so this change board header names
will be the new function for us and here
we would like to check whether the user
is winner or not so here we say
if
not when
then what then in that case we have to
say
let current player text equal
to document
dot query selector in this you'll be
getting the details like
dot Bo and here we're going to give the
name called
player and hyphen turn
player hyph turn now later on after this
particular variable we have to just
check the condition by saying
if current
player = to X if the position is X sorry
let me try to put in a capital letter
here
x then we to
say current player Dot
inner HTML equal to now here we have to
just use the same option called back Tex
because I want to go multi-lines that's
a benefit of this ptic and here we say
in our inner HTML
span class equal to
name hyphen
hyphen
style close this and here we want to
use the statement now this value we want
to write it with name attribute so it is
getting closed and here we are saying
dollar with this
player X
do
name and then close the span tag and we
say you are
up like this and after
that we say Do class equal to we just
going to create a class which later on
we can apply the CSS Style on the top of
that you hyphen R
hyphen
winner and here we say closing the D
tag so the D tag is closed that's it and
now after this line
what next we have this called else
condition else what else here we
say current
player
text Dot inner
HTML inner HTML equal
to after
this we're going to write the
span class equal to here we say
name hyphen hyphen same option we're
going to use it so in this condition so
winner conditions so let me try to copy
the same rather than copying it again
and
again I'll just copy the whole
text span class equal to name hyphen
hyphen style player rather than saying X
we have to use y you are up you are
winner okay so here it's getting
closed well after this what we have to
do create another function called reset
Port
function reset
board now in this function reset board
we just say
console.log a small
message
resetting resetting is added now
afterwards we'll be using the game board
and the same game board what we have
used it earlier I'll be using the same
conditions on the top if you remember
that was a game board for me so I'll be
using the same game board I copy
this
yeah with the same
condition okay game go to this after
that line we will say
let sell to add
token
sell to add token equal to document do
query selector
all here in this I'll be using another
class
called
letter
now sell to add token whichever we've
used
dot for
each
square and within this Square we would
like to use
Square
dot text content equal to
Black after that square
dot parent element
dot class list dot remove and and here
we would like to say
board okay underscore
uncore
cell winner so these classes we yet to
create because these CS classes we just
using this but we haven't created we'll
be using it little later
on so that was a
point now after that we are defining the
turn value turn equal to zero because we
are resetting it and
winner equal to
false after that winner equal to false
we just Define another variable called
Define let current player
text current player text equal
to document
dot query selector
all yeah document query select all world
so here we're going to use the name
called
board Define player hyphen hyphen
turn after that current
player current player
text current player text Dot inner HTML
equal to once again we have to use the
condition for up and winner point so let
me try to copy
this inner HTML equal
to okay and in this we have to say play
x.
name okay just everything is same no
change at
all okay now here after that we're going
to write one more function called
function
add
sell
click listener that mean when I be
adding or clicking something to my cell
what kind of event I would like to
listen
here we are saying
const CS equal
to document Dot
query selector
all let's
check the condition
board
Board sell and here once again we say
sell start for
each
dot for
each and here we say sell
dot add event
listener which event I want to
listen click and the second parameter
will be Handler on SC make
move okay and this function which we
have created called add self clicks
listener okay this I'll be calling it
here perfect later on once it is done
let's try to add one more function
called
function
remove
cell
click
listener remove cell click
listener now here we say let
all cells equal to document Dot
query selector
all let's
pass
board cell and now we
say all cells
do for
each
cell and here we say s
dot
remove even
listener which
event
click and second parameter will be
make that's it so friends now here most
of our JavaScript code is written now so
going forward we would like to use CSS
and finally we'll be applying everything
into our HTML file well after the
Javascript file is ready towards my
application now it's time to go and
create our HTML file sorry the CSS so
inside my Tic Tac I have got app.js and
index.html ready now here I'm going to
create another file here called app. CSS
see you can basically put this app. CSS
in any other folder like in static
folder but I have just kept it
outside now from this point onwards I
would like to start with my basic
functionality
okay what those are let's start with the
first feature called
body with my body some basic settings I
would like to do like in background
image background color so I just start
with background
color background color I can just use it
as a white okay uh but I don't think so
it's really needed it so if you want you
can have it otherwise leave this
background color because it's by default
going to be white only and now next
would be called
height height will be 800
pixels next background
position background position I just say
like
Center next background repeat in case if
you do not want to repeat the
image back background repeat and here I
say no repeat next background
size here we saying
cover okay it resizes the background
image to cover the entire container okay
so that's what the body part now the
next thing is we have to select the rest
of the CSS classes so first select
div do
relative
inside this dat. relative we first say
call
position position we are saying
absolute next is top from the top I'm
just making 760
pixels next
write WR we just saying 120
pixels next after this we are saying
height
container height Dot container or sorry
hide hyphen
container here in hide Hy container we
will
display display colum
n well after that we have to use the
header
Point header inside this header we will
say color will be by default white but
still we just say
color and
uh White next text
line we just say
Center next
margin margin will be 15
pixels next font family
font family I'm selecting called
permanent
Michael
permanent permanent
marker okay next class we are talking
about call inter player let is call
Dot enter
hyphen
players in inter hyen players we will
say
color we once again we can use any other
col but we can just use white or any
color you want or you can just use
hash okay margin
margin we're giving it called
zero Auto
width we're looking forward for
80% next text
align
Center
position
relative now next we're going forward
for input
fi in this input field we just say
border border 2
pixels
solid and
black next
outline outline none I do not want any
outline to be there
next
padding I can take four
pixels 8
pixels four pixels 8 pixels now
margin we saying 0 0 10
pixels okay and finally for
pixels after this margin we say font
size
18
pixels okay so that is your input field
next we are talking about something
called input field
Focus
input hyphen field okay
colon
Focus now here
border 2 pixel
solid
red or any other color which you want to
use it next how you want your submit
button to be so I'm saying
dot submit Hy
BTM
border two
pixels
solid and black
adding 8
pixels and again 8
pixels font
size 18
pixels now
width 250
pixels followed by border
5
pixels next your margin from
Top let's take 10
pixels after that background
color let's take
y20
okay so this is the property
now going forward you can associate with
your submit button active and submit
button Focus so we are saying
dot submit hyphen
BTN
colon
active
and two options we are taking followed
by condition outline
none
outline none next
border we're talking about call two
pixels
solid and the color
red okay so that's the
one and uh after that we like to use
over
dot submit Ty button
colon
over what you want change the background
color to what
white you can use white
smoke well here we like to use uh
dot
board here we would like to use
player hyphen
these are the classes we were using in
our JavaScript we remember and here we
say
color color we using once
again white or you can use this white
smoke whichever you
want
so but later on text
align Center
margin 10
pixels
0o and 10
pixels
height 54
pixels okay so these are the properties
initially we have taken okay so after
this turn let's go and start another
classes here I'm saying dot name hyphen
hyphen style and here we are saying
color
red and then font
size 22
pixels
well now coming back to the another
properties now we're talking about the
next important called border container
called board container
dot board container here we Define
width which is 40 pixels we are
taking or sorry 40% we can rather
take after that background
color that we can say coded
blue okay next
margin we're taking is
zero
and
Auto
after that font
size font size we are taking
zero next
border B we are taking two
pixels then
solid and then
black followed by box
Shadow you remember this Bo shed is one
of the very very c three popular
property here we defining 3

pixels 0
pixels and RGB we can talk about C
black okay so my border color will be
shading color will be black after that
we've offering this board set
dot now in this board cell we defining
width now in this width we using
calculation CA LC and in this
calculation we defining
100%
okay divided by three this calculation
after this the next property will be
display display will be inline
block next font
size we're taking 40
pixels well text
line Center border
we are taking two
pixels
solid and
black adding 20

family
this form you can use
permanent permanent
Mar okay now next option apart of this
we have a call your board
s
board cell
hyphen winner other
I now spelling wrong this has to be D
yeah board cell winner let's make
background
color

the color combination so color will
be
white next
position relative
top
50% next
transform translate
by to minus
50% after that font

permanent
Mark let me
copy okay
now here next option will be called
winner container here we're
giving
winner with
dot dot winner
hyen
container okay so for this winner
container what are the values we want to
use it that's you want to basically do
it so for this Winer container what I
would rather suggest is you can use
dot
reset text
Aline
Center
margin 20
pixels that is for reset and now reset
hidden
inside this reset hiden we will set
display
none
display

25% okay and uh followed by
padding 10 pixels we take it from here
and 20
pixels
border this border we are taking is
called two
pixels followed by
solid okay and black color
now later on Border
radius border radius we're taking 5
pixels later on
outline I'm saying
none after this outline we say letter
spacing now this letter spacing would be
again
zero after that text
transform this text transform value we
talking about called
upper case next font
size font size we're taking 16
pixels then margin
top margin top would be 12
pixels then word
spacing that you taking three
pixels followed by background
color this you're taking white as
usual so this is for your replay
button okay now in a similar line we can
also have call Dot replay hyph
bdn colon
hover followed by
dot replay
[Music]
hyphen active
now apply the common style
outline we are making it
null then
color we are making it is called
White then background
color will be
black okay and when we comes to the
congratulations so we'll be using this
Dot
okay so this congratulations class will
be using font
size to what 24
pixels and uh after this we are using
this called winner. u hyph r do
winner in this winner we'll be
taking font
size okay that's 18
pixels after that
height we are taking 18 pixels
again then line height
line height we are taking 18
pixels and
then margin 2
pixels and then
zero okay that's it so last but not
least we would like to use this uh
dot
replay hyphen bdn
this I'm seeing with
50%
50% so this is what my CSS file is all
set I know it was pretty lengthy but it
is required for this particular
application okay everyone so we are all
ready with our CSS also now it's time to
go back to our index.html file and take
care about our final finishing touch so
we have this index.html file with us and
now the CSS class which we were using it
in our application that is known as
called this U permanent marker this
class is not by default available so we
have to include this using this external
API so here where we have a called CSS
with us before that we
want
link So within this link we want a
variable name called
HF equal to now we have to give the
proper location by saying
https colou for/
fonts. Google
apis okay
Doom SL
CSS question
mark family equal Al
to
permanent
plus
marker okay so if you just copy this
into your browser you will get to know
where exactly it is using okay if I just
copy and paste it so I just need to say
https before yeah
https fonts Dot
googleapis.com
SL oh spelling
ground CSS family equal to permanent
marker that is the main URL from where I
can take this kind of font so
here CSS so that's what I was cross
verifying it well it's there we have
included our CSS also but in which class
we need to use that is are important now
JS I also want to include it so here in
my head tag only I would like to
include
script SRC equal to
app.js so here my script is actually
loaded now after that if I just go back
and check the final outcome of my code
which is index. HTML
file well it pretty much look like in
basic nothing else has started when we
talk about called start
game okay so it needs to start because
there is no CSS class are attached so I
need to attach those classes within my
code so here onwards we have to start
with offering those CSS classes so that
at least I can apply those common
behaviors to my application
okay like here we have a call D we
haven't attached any class to this after
this body we have a called div H1 class
equal to header T tag to then we have a
call div we have a
call
Body uh under this we have a call
another D tag so just imagine how many
type of classes are available one we
have called div class equal to header
div class is closed again then we have a
called one more D tag so like that
multiple CSS files are there where we
have to apply the new CSS class to make
it happen so now we have to just go back
and change our HTML and to apply our
main class so this is what my final HTML
which looks like the same you can see we
have added all those type of CSS classes
which we had that is called inter player
player form player container label
placeholder and player container and if
see all different type of classes we
have attached this to okay because here
only my CSS class will get applied and
the JavaScript will apply those kind of
dynamic CSS based on certain conditions
so these CSS classes are already there
add it inside your HTML page our app CSS
is ready app.js is also ready now let's
go back and try to reveal how it looks
like awesome so it looks like pretty
nice dtto is a game it is expecting when
I say start game it says You must enter
a name for each field validation is
working let me try to
add two names and say start game awesome
so now you can see it is saying a you
are up now let me try to give the
values awesome now you can see it's
saying like hey you are a winner great
so guys congratulations on this the
first example of how the Tic Tac do game
is used hey guys I'm sure you all have
heard about phrases like web development
frontend development backend development
and so on but if you're not sure about
what exactly they mean don't worry
you're in the right place in this video
we will focus on backend development I
suggest you check out our other videos
on frontend versus backend and full
stack development
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an
update so here are the topics that we're
going to be
covering first we'll see what exactly
backend development is then we'll
understand who exactly a backend
developer is moving on we'll look at
some of the skills that a backend
developer must have finally we'll look
at some of the job roles and job respons
possibilities of a backend
developer from there we'll look at the
salary of a backend developer and lastly
I'll let you know how we can help you so
first let's begin by understanding what
backend development
is now web development that occurs at
the back end of programs is accurately
termed as backend development backend
development covers the server side
application logic like integration
writing apis creating libraries and
working with system components as
opposed to front end development which
focuses on customer facing services and
programs now backend development
involves ensuring data integrity and
consistency and also involves scripting
and writing code to communicate with the
database now that you know what backend
development is I'm sure you have an idea
about what a backend developer does but
to name a few a backend developer is the
one who builds an effective website
architecture who also writes code to
communicate with the database and again
again as mentioned ensures data
integrity and consistency now
essentially a backend developer handles
what you don't see they're in charge of
the back end of a website which includes
servers database applications and so
forth so if you wish to become a backend
developer you can but there are a few
skills that you need to have so let's
look at the skills that you need to hone
to become a successful backend
developer first up is data structures
and algorithms now you must have a good
understanding of data structures and
algorithms understanding how the data is
being stored is crucial so Concepts like
Stacks cues link lists sorting and
search algorithms are
important next we have programming
languages and
Frameworks one of the most critical
skills of a backend developer is the
in-depth knowledge of backend
programming languages this includes
JavaScript and its environments like
nodejs and expressjs Java in particular
was built from from the ground up to be
run on server side so popular JavaScript
Frameworks like spring and JSF are also
important moving ahead we have python
which is the most popularly used
language now it is flexible and easy to
use so there are Frameworks like d Jango
and flask again these are crucial and
it's important to have a good
understanding of these
Frameworks we also have cop which is a
preferred architecture for backend
programming so it includes asp.net code
and net MVC now other programming
languages include PHP Pearl and Ruby and
since backend and front-end developers
work so closely it's also helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end web Technologies like HTML and
CSS proficiency is required not only for
performing daily tasks but also for
working alongside frontend developers to
develop
Solutions so moving ahead we have
Version Control now Version Control
Systems help manage the project files
and keep track of the entire history of
users things so popular ones are git
GitHub and sub version now git helps
manage the project files it keeps track
of the entire history of things that the
user is working on right and GitHub is a
web- based service for Version Control
using
git moving ahead we have database
Management Systems now a backend
developer writes code that is used to
perform relational mapping to fetch data
from the database so some popularly used
database Management systems are MySQL
there poster SQL SQL server and you also
have
mongodb and lastly we have web hosting
platforms now web hosting platforms
allow you to deploy your product on a
cloud service provider so it can be
accessed from the worldwide web now
popular ones are Amazon web services
Google Cloud platform Heroku and
Microsoft aour
now of course a backend developer should
also possess non-technical skills like
problem solving critical thinking decent
communication practices and analytical
skills now they should be a debt to
working independently as well as in a
collaborated team now that you're
familiar with the skills let's have a
look at the key responsibilities and
roles of a backend
developer to begin with roles a backend
developer could be assigned the
following roles backend developer Java
developer full stack developer devops
engineer software engineer and iOS
Developer and here is a list of
responsibilities first
up is to form an understanding of the
website's performance needs and goals to
develop effective and efficient
Solutions development and management of
application programming
interfaces having a good knowledge on
programming and ensuring framework
utilization developing solutions for
websites to accept and store data
securely especially for those involved
with Payment
Processing writing testing and
maintaining the development solutions
for code related
issues effectively communicating with
developers designers and system
administrators and organization of
system logic now it's also crucial to
ensure the development of website
architecture using proper methodologies
like agile scrum and
framework and it's also important to
know how to troubleshoot and debug
applications so now that you're familiar
with those responsibilities and
roles let's have a look at the backend
developer
salary according to glass store a
backend developer in the United States
earns around $102,000 us perom while in
India a backend developer earns an
average salary of 7 lak 23,000 Indian
rupees perom so now that you're familiar
with backend development and know what
the roles and responsibilities are You
Must Be Wondering Where to Begin well
look no further you can head to the
official simply learn website and just
search for backin development a number
of Articles courses and programs will
appear you can also choose the one that
suits you best you can just click on the
program and get an overview of what the
course consists of and depending on your
requirements you can opt for the course
that is most appropriate for you for
today's session the topic of discussion
is how to become a backend developer so
if you're wondering how to become a
backend developer what skills are
required and what the responsibilities
are then you're in the right place but
let's wait for a while for more people
to tune
in
I'd also like to thank all our viewers
for actively participating in these
sessions all right so uh whilst you're
at it if you haven't subscribed to our
Channel already make sure to hit the
Subscribe button and the bell icon to
never miss an update okay so I see a lot
of people tuning
in all right so I think we're good to
begin
now I'm sure all of you use social media
applications now every time you click on
a video scroll through a feed perhaps
search for something the corresponding
information is displayed on your screen
now these applications provide an
excellent user experience but how is
this achieved you must know that every
application comprises of two parts
there's the front end and then there's
the back end the front end is what the
user de deals with and the back end is
what makes this
happen in other words the back end
includes an application a server and a
database the backend application fetches
the data from the database and processes
all client requests the result of this
is made visible to the
user so now the question arises who is a
backin
developer a backend developer's role is
to focus on details like building an
effective website architecture scripting
and writing code that serves as a means
of communication between the websites
database and the
browser and lastly to ensure data
integrity and
consistency so now let's look at the
skills required to become a backend
developer it is vital for you to have
good understanding of programming
Concepts like data structures and
algorithms this includes Stacks cues
link lists trees and graphs sorting
algorithms and search
algorithms next up is programming
languages and Frameworks one of the most
critical skills of a backend developer
is a depth of knowledge in backend
programming
languages this includes Proficiency in
JavaScript and its environments like
nodejs and
expressjs next is Java this language was
particularly built from the ground up to
be run on server
side popular Frameworks include spring
and Java server
faes next up is python which is the most
popularly used language today it is
flexible and easy to use Python
Frameworks like Django and flask are
used for backend
development and lastly there cop and its
Frameworks like asp.net core and asp.net
MVC
other languages include Pearl PHP and
Ruby now because backend and front end
developers work so closely together it
is also helpful to have a foundational
understanding of front-end web languages
like HTML and
CSS now proficiency is essential not
only for performing daily tasks but also
for working alongside frontend
Developers for developing
Solutions next we have database
management system systems a backend
developer writes code that is used to
perform relational mapping to fetch data
from the database some popularly used
dbms are MySQL SQL server and postc SQL
next up is Version Control again popular
ones are git and sub version they help
manage the project files and keep track
of the entire history of things that the
developer is working
on
and lastly there's Cloud hosting
platforms these platforms allow you to
deploy your product on the cloud service
provider so that it can be accessed from
the worldwide web most popular ones are
Amazon web services Google Cloud
platform Heroku and Microsoft
Azure of course there are non-technical
skills that are required of backend
developers those who choose this
profession should be comfortable with
analytical processes have well-developed
problem solving capabilities be
interested in emerging technologies have
good communication skills and be able to
work independently and sometimes as a
part of a collaborative team now that
you're familiar with the skills let's
have a look at the responsibilities of a
backend
developer first up is forming an
understanding of the performance needs
and goals of the website to develop
effective successful
Solutions
development and management of
application programming
interfaces development of systems for
websites to accept and securely stored
data such as those required for payment
processing
systems then there's a writing code
testing and development solutions for
COD related
issues then there's organization of
system logic other responsibilities also
include development of site architecture
using proper methodology like agile
scrum framework and also providing
solutions to system problems lastly
let's have a look at the salaries of a
backend
developer the average salary of a
backend developer in the United States
is around
$12,000 us per year the average salary
of a backend developer in India is
around 7 lak 23,000 Indian rupees per
anom hey guys I'm sure you all have
heard about phrases like web development
full stack development front end and
backend
development but if you are not sure
about what exactly they mean or how
they're different then don't worry
you're in the right place this video on
front-end versus backend development
will help you differentiate the
two but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an
update now let's Jump Right In and look
at whats in story for
us so first we look at what exactly web
development is then we look at the
different types of web
development going ahead we'll look at
what frontend development is and
understand what exactly backend
development
is and lastly we'll be comparing the two
on the basis of languages libraries and
Frameworks skills job roles and
salary
so now let's begin by understanding what
web development
is web development is the process of
creating a website on the
internet it refers to the non-design
aspects of a website such as creating
features and functionality using
programming markup and scripting
languages developers concentrate on the
technical aspects of web development
such as architecture programming
application integration and graphics
now let's look at the different types of
web
development now web development could
include the front end and the back end
now
together they form something called as
full stack development now I'm sure you
wondering what they actually mean so
let's go ahead and understand
them let's begin by understanding what
front end development
is now frontend development is the part
of the website that codes and creates
front- endend elements of a website
which are features that are directly
viewable and accessible by the client
now essentially a front end developer is
in charge of everything you see be it
styling Graphics text alignment
navigation colors Etc and he attempts
and he attempts to improve the user
experience to make it as seamless as
possible now these frontend developers
also contribute to the overall design
and aesthetic along with
debugging responsiveness and performance
are the two main objectives of frontend
development then what exactly is backend
development you guessed it right now web
development that occurs at the back end
of programs is accurately termed as
backend
development now this backend development
covers servers side web application
logic and integration and activities
like writing apis creating Library and
working with system competence as
opposed to front end development which
focuses on customer facing services and
programs now backend developers create
code that allows database and an
application to communicate with each
other essentially a backend developer
handles what you don't see they are in
charge of the back end of the website
which includes servers databases and
applications so now that you have a
brief understanding of what front-end
development is and backend devel
velopment is let's go ahead and compare
the
two so we'll be comparing the two based
on five different features that is
languages libraries and Frameworks
skills job roles and
salaries now let's begin with languages
now front end development typically
includes coding using languages like
HTML CSS and JavaScript now as you all
know HTML is a markup language that is
standardized system for tagging text
text files to achieve font color
graphics and hyperlinks now CSS is used
to format the layout of these web pages
and JavaScript is used to create
interactive elements on the web
page when it comes to backend the
languages include python chash Java
Pearl PHP Ruby and some JavaScript now
Java in particular was built from ground
up to run on the server side so Java is
extremely useful py is also one of the
most popularly used languages and C
language is the preferred architecture
for backend programming in Windows
environments now talking about libraries
and Frameworks frontend libraries and
Frameworks include reactjs angular view
jQuery and bootstrap while talking about
backend Frameworks we have expressjs
node spring Django flask JSF asp.net and
net
MVC now front-end and backend developers
work very closely so it's helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end developer Technologies like
HTML and CSS as well moving on to skills
now front-end developers are in charge
of bringing visual elements to a website
as well as interactive elements such as
navigation buttons and anything else
that improves overall
usability HTML JavaScript and CSS are
frequently used to ensure that a site's
visual side operates well so it's
crucial to know these languages and a
good understanding of JavaScript
Frameworks and libraries is also
essential and other General skills
include a good grasp of front-end
programming languages the ability to
create a responsive design the knowledge
of testing and debugging and an
understanding of frontend development
tools like automation content management
Version Control
Systems talking about the skills
required for backend
development now back backend developers
deal with backend languages and
Frameworks like Java Ruby on Rails Etc
now backend developers deal with
languages like Java Ruby on Rails Etc to
make web pages and applications operate
now it's vital to know commonly used
backend languages and Frameworks like d
Jango nodejs expressjs and so on other
important skills include database
management framework utilization
programming knowledge of accessibility
and security compliance and
understanding requirements and ensuring
data consistency and integrity now
moving ahead let's look at some of the
job roles for frontend and backend
development talking about front end we
have the front end developer the CSS or
HTML developer we have front-end web
designer we have frontend SEO expert
full stack developer and a UI
developer talking about backend this
backend developer Java developer full
stack developer de Ops engineer software
engineer and an iOS
Developer and lastly let's look at the
salaries offered to these front-end and
backend
developers in India the average salary
of a front-end developer is around 6
lakh rupees
perom while a backend developer earns
about 7 lakh rupees perom in the US a
front-end developer earns around
$100,000 perom while a backend developer
earns about
$121,000 perom hey everyone welcome to
another video by simply learn in today's
video we're going to be comparing two
commonly used technology Stacks that is
mean stack and M
Stack but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure you hit the Subscribe button and
the bell icon to never miss an
update so first let's begin by
understanding what exactly is a
technology stack now a technology stack
is a combination of programming
languages Frameworks and tools that
developers use to build a web or a
mobile application now the two main
components of any app are the client
side and then the server side and each
layer of the application is built a top
of the other thus creating a stack now
the server side is not visible to the
user but it programming languages power
the user site and create the logic of
websites and
applications when it comes to to client
side now this is everything that users
can see on their screens and where the
interaction is happening the three main
technologies that fall under client site
or HTML CSS and
JavaScript so now that you know what a
technology stack is let's go ahead and
understand what exactly is mean
stack now mean stack is defined as the
collection of JavaScript technologies
that assist in building complex better
websites right now mean is basically an
abbreviation that stands for mongod DB
expressjs angularjs and
nodejs now this framework provides quick
and easy development of web and mobile
applications it also provides popular
plugins and reduces time on system
administration so if you want to speed
up the process of web and mobile
application means stack is an
appropriate choice now while talking
about the competence mongodb here is
used to store the data of backend
applications like Json files expressjs
is a backend application that runs on
top of nodejs you have angular which is
the front end framework that runs the
code on the browser and then you have
nodejs which provides runtime system for
JavaScript on the backend web
application so this was all about mean
stack so let's go ahead and understand
what M Stack is now M Stack like means
stack is also an abbreviation so it
stands for mongod DB expressjs reactjs
and nodejs now this framework also
provides quick and easy development of
web applications using Java as its main
component now it is used for development
of websites and it makes use of
libraries databases and Frameworks now M
Stack ensures a smooth development
process and is becoming increasingly
popular in the development market then
again mongodb here it is a document
oriented nosql database that is used to
store backend data then you have
expressjs which is a layered framework
built on top of nodejs and it takes care
of all the websites backend
functionality and structure you have
reactjs which is a JavaScript library
that creates user interface components
for web applications and then you have
nodejs which is a runtime environment
capable of running JavaScript on a
machine right so this was M Stack now
you must be wondering what exactly ly
are the differences between M Stack and
mean stack so let's go ahead and look at
them first up is the obvious difference
that in mean stack we use angular while
in mon stack we use
reactjs now angular is obviously a
JavaScript framework used to build
single page applications while react is
an open source JavaScript library used
to render components for a smooth user
experience next up meanstack uses
typescript language while M Stack uses
JavaScript and jsx now jsx is a
combination of JavaScript and HTML now
since mean stack uses angular the flow
of data is bidirectional that means any
changes made to the view part of the
application is reflected in the model
part as well and vice versa but in the
case of monack which uses react it uses
uni directional flow of data meaning
first the model state is updated and
then all the changes are rendered to the
view part of the application
next up is that mean stack has a better
learning curve you need to know all the
concepts of angular like data binding
services routing bootstrap Etc and in
case of M Stack it offers excellent
documentation making development
extremely
smooth so now you must be wondering
which one to choose now you know what
mean stack is you know what M Stack is
you know how they function what the
stack comprises of what are the
different types of Concepts that can be
used Etc but if you're wondering what to
choose then this section will help you
clarify the out so there are many
companies that readily use different
types of stacks for web development so
companies like Accenture raindrop wangle
among others use mean stack while
companies like Uber Eats Instagram
Walmart use M
Stack also both the stacks provide an
incredible user experience and stability
and scalability are the objectives of
both these Stags now Enterprise level
projects require mean over M and M makes
rendering the user interface simpler and
both of these are quick for frontend
development however mean stack is good
for large scale applications and mon
stack is used for faster development of
smaller applications so in conclusion
one isn't necessarily better than the
other but choosing the right stack for
your software process depends on the
front end framework or related tools
that you would like to use right so if a
developer or team prefers using angular
they may choose to work with mean stack
meanwhile a developer or a team that
enjoys using react will gravitate
towards M Stack so it's basically just
your choice and your requirements hi
guys I'm sure you've all heard the
phrases software development and web
development and I wouldn't be surprised
if you use them interchangeably or even
mistook a software developer for a web
developer well let me break your bubble
they are different so hey everyone
welcome to another live session by
simply La today's topic of discussion is
software developer versus web developer
but before we begin I'd like to thank
all our viewers for actively
participating in these
sessions I'd also like to welcome
everyone joining in from
Facebook
uh so let's wait for a while for more
people to tune
in at any point during the session if
you have any questions let us know in
the chat section one of our team members
will get back to you
immediately so whilst we're at it if you
haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to subscribe and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an
update that being said I think we should
begin
now
so here's what's in store for us
today first we'll understand who a web
developer is and then we'll see who a
software developer is later we'll
compare the two on the basis of their
press or their skill set the type of
product they build product compatibility
learning curve job titles and
salary and also at the end I'll help you
with which career path to
choose so moving ahead who is a web
developer now a web developer builds and
maintains websites and other web
applications he takes web design and
turns it into a website web developers
are responsible for how a website or web
application looks and functions from its
user interface and page layout to
backend systems for Gathering data a web
developer is expected to collaborate
with clients stakeholders and
organization leaders to design unique
and engaging websites for businesses
nonprofits government agencies and
anyone else who's looking to communicate
more effectively
online so diving a bit deeper a web
developer can specialize in different
areas based on their skill you have the
frontend developers now these are
experts who are in charge of how
websites and applications look and
function from the users
perspective next there are backend
developers who focus on the technical
aspects of websites and web applications
that support both basic and advanced
functionality now they largely work on
administrative components which include
databases website architecture
application logic creating new apis and
user interfaces based on predefined
speciic
specifications and lastly there are full
stack developers who are professionals
responsible for the development of an
application from start to finish they
specialize in both front end and back
end of the application
development typically a web developer
should have good skills in various
Frameworks and markup languages like
HTML CSS
JavaScript react CHS angular and
database Management Systems like mongodb
and backend tools like
node so I hope this helped you
understand who a web developer is some
of their responsibilities and their
basic skill
set next up let's understand who a
software developer
is now software developers are
responsible for creating more complex
applications and programs for computers
and mobile devices they create
conceptualize program document test and
upgrade software and their
components software developers invent
manage and optimize computer programs
that run on desktops laptops smartphones
and other mobile
devices these computer science
professionals write complex code that
governs how desktop applications
function they also specialize in
troubleshooting code bugs updating user
interfaces creating new tools and much
more just like web developers
Professionals in this field are often
categorized into specific roles based on
their
specializations we have the application
software developer and the system
software developer now an application
software engineer is a professional who
focuses on designing specific specific
desktop and mobile applications tools
and games for Consumer
audiences and a system software
developer is largely concerned with
designing systems level software for
Enterprise customers rather than the
public the software they develop is used
to manage corporate Network apps
database Management systems and other
critical
infrastructure talking about their
desirable skills they need to be
proficient in in programming in the
field of JavaScript Java cop PHP Python
and Ruby they must also have a good
understanding of operating systems
Network and database
management so now moving on to the main
topic of discussion software developer
versus web
developer first let's compare the two
based on their press or area of EXP
ities a software developer is associated
with developing products that can be run
on multiple systems this product could
be any kind of software their area of
work includes requirement analysis
planning coding testing of applications
implementation deployment and
maintenance talking about web developers
they are responsible for the development
of websites they're also expected to
follow the process of the software
development life cycle while building
their
products next up is the type of product
now a software developer creates
programs for Standalone desktop or
mobile
platforms on the other hand a web
developer takes care of the web
framework serers side functions API
integration and the business
Logic the the third point of comparison
is product
compatibility now software development
applications are compatible across
multiple operating systems or
platforms the web applications on the
other hand are designed to be compatible
across multiple web
browsers next up is the learning
curve well software engineering never
focuses exclusively on coding however
you should know at least a couple of
languages and a deeper understanding of
how they function some of the languages
that you should be proficient in include
Java C Python and some of its libraries
and Frameworks JavaScript and Ruby among
others a web developer should be
familiar with markup languages like HTML
CSS JavaScript libraries and Frameworks
like react and angular he should also
have a good hold of backend Frameworks
like python Django and
node the next parameter is the job title
now there are different job titles for
these professions some of them for
software development are software
developer software engineer Junior
software developer senior software
developer and a software architect on
the other hand a web developer could
receive titles like front- end developer
backend developer full stack developer
or just a web developer now of course
companies have discretion over assigning
these job roles to their
employees lastly let's look at the job
outlook and
salaries now the job growth projections
for software developers are even more
optimistic than those for web
development roles alongside promising
job growth software developers also have
higher salaries than other it
professionals
now the average salary of a software
developer in the US is around $76,000 us
per anom and the average salary of a
software developer in India is around 5
lakh Indian rupees
perom for a web developer the average
salary in the US is around $68,000 us
per anom and in India it's around 4 lakh
Indian rupees
perom
now I'm sure you must be confused as to
which one to
choose well to be frank it's just a
matter of preference if you have strong
knowledge of data structures file
systems algorithms Source Control
operating and network systems then
software development would be a better
choice but if you have creative ideas
for websites love designing them have a
good understanding of HTML and CSS and
ultimately The Knack to integrate your
design ideas to create responsive user
interfaces then a web development role
could be a good career path then web
development could be a better career
path to
choose in this session we will discuss
Matrix chain
multiplication we shall begin our
session by discussing the problem
statement then we will discuss the
algorithmic solution to the metrix chain
multiplication problem finally we will
implement the solution to the metrix
chain multiplication problem in the code
rator but before we begin make sure you
have subscribed to our YouTube channel
and clicked on the Bell icon below so
you never miss an update from Simply
learns YouTube channel so without any
further Ado let's get started with the
problem
statement we will be given a sequence of
Matrix we have to find the most
efficient way to multiply these matrices
together the problem is not actually to
perform the multiplication but merely to
decide in which order to perform the
multiplication to get the minimum
operations on a
multiplication now let's discuss the
algorithmic solution to the Matrix chain
multiplication first we will take Matrix
sequence and divide it into two
subsequence then we will calculate the
minimum cost of multiplying out each
subsequence then we will add these costs
together and in the price of
multiplication the two result matrices
finally we will repeat these steps for
every possible sequence of matrices that
can be split and take a minimum over all
of them we have now discussed the
problem statement and the algorithmic
solution to metrix chain multiplication
now let's implement this solution in the
code
editor first we will Define Max
10 so #
Define
Max
10 now we will look up tables to store
the solution to already computed of
problems
so and look
up with Dimension is Max
Max now we will write a function to find
the most efficient way to multiply a
given sequence of
matrices
int MCM
and
M comma n i comma int
J now we will write our base case that
is one matx so
if J J is less than equals
to I +
1 then we will return
zero now what if it stores the minimum
number of scalar multiplication that is
cost needed to compute Matrix m i + 1 to
MJ which is equals to Mi I to J so in
men should be equals
to int underscore
Max now if the sub problem is seen for
the first time then we we will solve it
and store its result in the lookup table
so
if look
up at
I comma
J is equals to
Z then we will take the minimum over
each possible position at which the
sequence of matrices can be
split so
four
and K is equal
to I +
1 K less than equals 2
jus1 and K
++ now we will recover for M from I + 1
to MK to get an iix K
Matrix
in
first will be equals
to
MCM
DS comma I comma
K now we will recur for m k + 1 to MJ to
get an K XJ
Matrix so
cost plus equals
to
MCM
dims
comma K comma
J
then we will write the cost to multiply
2 iix K and kxj
Matrix
so
cost plus equals
to
D at
I multi by
dims
a multiply by
DMS at
J now
if
first is less than
min
then Min will be equals to
cost now we will
store men at look up at I comma
J
now we will return the minimum cost to
multiply m j + 1 to MJ so we will
return look
up at I
comma
J now let's define The
Matrix and
dims equals
to 10 comma 30 comma
5 comma
60
now we will find the size of this dims
array so
int n equals to size
of
Ms divided by size
of at
dims SC zero
now see
out the
minimum
first
is
MCM
at
dims comma 0
comma nus
one now let's execute
this as you can see we are getting the
minimum cost s
10 so our function is working
flawlessly the first one is practice
from Basics followed by that we have
consistency in learning next we have the
paper and Pen approach up next we have
run the program or code later we have
learn data structures and algorithm
Concepts on the next sixth step we have
step-by-step
approach next after that on the seventh
stage we have to follow the programmer
communities next we have solve some
questions then we have learning from the
feedbacks of other developers finally
having some projects for the portfolios
we will discuss each one of these points
in
detail first let's discuss about
practice from the basics the first one
is practice for the basics when we start
programming we start with an easy
problem for some resources and then move
on to the next level these cover all
Concepts and provide you with the idea
of
learning the next step on practicing
from the basics is develop new and
creative ideas on moving further
practice enough on several questions
from Easy level then move on to the
intermediate level questions and try to
solve some variety of questions on this
level then proceed to the complex
problems on the next step of practicing
from the basics we have built knowledge
and get experience in development when
we try practicing in this manner it is
better to gain knowledge on coding and
get experience over programming now we
have finished the first stage let's move
on to the next stage where we have
consistency in
learning so the first step in the second
stage is consistency helps to get more
command in learning it is popular saying
that practice makes a man perfect we
often take up a challenge to solve a
question and then discontinue in the
middle after some days this should not
be
happening in the second step we have
improve the ability to gain knowledge
practicing consistency will help a lot
in overall logic building process and
also other than that it improves and
helps to gain more
knowledge the third step increase the
development speed and logic building
practicing consistently also improves
the development speed and also helps in
building confidence confidence levels in
programming now we have finished with
the second stage let's move on to the
third stage where we have pen and
paper so the first step in the third
stage is representing helps to solve
problems quite
easily representing on paper will help
you in writing the code and improve your
programming skills in a better way trial
and error methodologies are much easier
to implement on paper before applying
the final Solutions through computers
the Second Step it also improves the
knowledge and logic building when we see
any problem we generally start coding on
our IDE so when an interviewer asks us
to write a code on paper we fail to do
so always try to write and implement the
code or algorithm of the code before
starting on your
IDE now the third step is increase the
speed of development and building
whenever you approach a similar problem
in the next time you you will be able to
recollect more easily it will also help
you in speeding up your
development now we are done with the
stage three we have stage four now that
is run program or
code so the first step in run program or
code is practicing is the key to develop
new ideas one of the best ways to
develop logic building in programming is
learning data structures Concepts and
these Concepts provide an idea on how to
build an
algorithm the Second Step says running
program or a code provides an
opportunity to learn the working process
running or coding a program can also
help get an idea of working process of
the program which is a significant
benefit in building the
logic so the third step is running a
program or code helps you build and get
more experience over
programming it helps you improve your
programming and gets experience in
programming and SK scale up your
performance by building confidence
levels so now we are done with stage
four we have stage five that is learn
data structures and algorithms
Concepts so the first step in learning
data structures and algorithms Concepts
is data structures and algorithms
Concepts help you build algorithms and
Logics one of the best ways to develop
logic building and programming is
learning data structures Concepts and
these concept provide an idea on how to
build an algorithm so the second step in
learning data structures and algorithms
Concepts is develop programming skills
in a programmer so when we can build or
Implement an algorithm it is easy to
develop programming skills in a person
so now the third step is increase the
ability and knowledge of programming
developing an algorithm provides a good
knowledge piee and also helps in
increasing the development time now we
are done with the stage five let's get
on to the stage six so the stage six is
all about step-by-step approach so the
first step in stage six
is provide more clarity and clear
understanding we don't start talking
from the day we are born similarly we
should not directly jump into learning
all the concepts it is better to keep a
step-by-step approach like a procedure
we should go from basic to advanced
level questions it provides more clarity
and clear understanding sometimes people
solve a lot of easy questions from all
the sites but they are not able to solve
medium level questions instead make a
balance of these
levels
next helps think logically and have the
complete idea step-by-step approach
helps in clearing the coding test and
gives an opportunity to build the skills
in a
person now we are done with the stage
six let's get into the stage
seven that is programmers
community find various questions and
their Logics we often get bored while
solving the problems all by ourselves
with no one to teach or guide us through
the programmer Community we can get an
opportunity to find various questions
and solve them in a better way or it may
also happen that you know the problem
solution and you may guide someone else
as well now the second step is clean and
clear explanation for better ideas
solving various questions seriously will
help you to get more complete IDE aidea
of the working process and development
process of a program which is a benefit
in building logic in you now the last
step is it improves logic with various
development
techniques programmer communities help
you build confidence in you and provide
an opportunity to develop more skills so
far we are done with Stage seven now we
enter the stage eight which is about
solving questions so the first step in
stage eight is solving questions will
help help you improve your ability to
work on different questions if you want
to build and develop logic skills you
must try solving as many questions as
possible it provides an opportunity to
work on various types of problems and
solve
them now the second step is it gives you
a complete idea of the program and
development solving questions will
seriously help you get a complete idea
of the working process and development
process of a program which is a benefit
and building logic in you now the third
step solving questions will help you or
provide an opportunity to develop more
skills it also builds confidence in you
and provides an opportunity to develop
more skills now we're done with stage
eight let's enter Stage Nine that is
about learning from feedbacks the first
step in learning from feedbacks is
identify the mistakes and improve the
ideas one of the best ways to improve
knowledge and build logic is learning
from feedback when you implement or
develop any any program you must go for
a second opinion or feedback and once
you go through a feedback it helps you
to identify mistakes and award them in
the
future the next step is develop the
debugging skills and improve logical
skills so learning from feedbacks help
you build debugging skills and improve
more command on the programming
language now the third step learning
from feedback helps you improve the
development speed and knowledge when we
try to know the mistake that we have
made previously it helps you you get an
idea over programming it increases the
development speed and builds more logic
now we are done with Stage Nine and we
have the last stage that is stage 10
projects so the first step in projects
is working on projects provides and
helps you build
ideas one of the most important things
that a beginner or an experienced person
should follow to get better at
programming logic is to do projects
working on some real life projects will
give you an exposure and experience to
become better at programming the second
step is it improves the ability and
development speed you can make any small
application or if you're an experienced
person then you can build some complex
or big projects it improves your skills
and Bild logic in your personality you
also get an idea of how the workflow of
creating a project goes
on finally develop creative on logical
skills when you work on a project you
need to solve a big problem by breaking
it into smaller steps this helps you to
improve your logic building skills and
creativity levels so if you also want to
become a successful software developer
and gain handsome salary packages then
look at the wide range of software
development courses by simply learn in
collaboration with the top universities
across the globe by enrolling in any of
these certification programs you will
Master modern coding techniques with
boot camp level intensity becoming a
fullstack technologist this program lays
the foundation for crafting fullstack
web applications so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll now a year of
experience is preferred to enroll in
these courses so check out the link
mentioned in the description box below
for more
details so let's get started with our
beginner JavaScript questions we have
multiple levels available here we start
with the beginner level first so the
first question is always like what do
you understand about a JavaScript so we
know very well the JavaScript is a very
very popular scripting language it is
basically designed for client side
scripting and server side scripting
development why server site because
nowadays JavaScript is also used in a
backend using node GS so that's why it
is also called for server side
development so the question is like uh
JavaScript is actually also helps the
developers to develop some more
responsive HTML pages okay which can be
well understood and executed by the web
browser okay which having the support
capabilities for objectoriented
programming
skills now the next question is like
what is the difference between a
JavaScript and Java see the reason is
because the JavaScript initials are Java
so everybody think like okay there is
some relationship with the Java so
actually the thing is like there is no
relationship with Java I would say
JavaScript is object based language
whether Java is objectoriented language
lot of syntax uh and some standards are
matching with Java that's why exactly it
is saying it is
Javascript otherwise there is nothing
like that but another difference if I
talk about JavaScript is mainly designed
to run with the browsers where the Java
is designed especially for the virtual
machine and operating system now the
another thing is like JavaScript does
not need a compilation because it is
directly use interpreter but when you
talk about called Java it requires a
compiler as well as a interpreter
both now what type of various data types
are supported so all standard data types
I can bite short int long float double
character Boolean these all different
type of data types are supported in
JavaScript also just like in traditional
programming
languages okay now what are the features
of JavaScript so the first feature which
you always remember is it is a
lightweight programming language it is
been interpreted by the browsers rather
than
compile it is a cross platform that
means it can work across multiple
browsers so it is not specific to the
browsers so that we need to understand
next it is an open source hence you do
not need to pay for any licensing fees
it comes free with all different type of
browsers it is an object oriented but I
would not say as a pure object oriented
I would rather say it is an object based
language next it can gel well with
multiple front end as well as the
backend Technologies because most of the
languages which are coming up in a
market they have a support available to
get integrated with the JavaScript and
due to that JavaScript is very very
popular so it is also used especially
for the development like a network based
application so in case if if you want to
have some kind of network Centric
application here the JavaScript really
suits very very
well okay next question what are the
advantages of JavaScript so the First
Advantage which we are talking about
like JavaScript basically have a very
very nice interactive language it is a
event based okay functional programming
language I would say so it is a quick
feedback because it loads very very very
fast in your existing web pages it is
giving you the support of developing a
very very rich user interface because of
that your application look consistent
across multiple type of
[Music]
browsers another is like we have a
called variety of JavaScript based
Frameworks are available like you can
talk about angular you talk about react
you talk about VI they're all basically
different type of Javas based Frameworks
that helps a developer to enhance their
skills with writing less amount of codes
so how you create a script or how you
create an object in JavaScript it is
very simple the curly braces curly
braces is basically designed to give you
the feel of this is a typical object
there are variety of ways are there to
create an object in JavaScript which
we're going to see uh in our next
PPD okay now here we see about the next
set of questions which are there with us
like how to create array in JavaScript
so creating an arrays in JavaScript is
very very easy now you can see the
square brackets okay there are way to
basically create a array in a JavaScript
so just a square brackets are a very
very simpler way so-called laterals to
create the array objects in JavaScript
actually you should know that array is
also object which is a predefined object
comes with your JavaScript so-called
implicit
objects now what are the build-in
methods available in JavaScript so you
remember about these methods comes from
those build-in objects comes with your
JavaScript as we have mentioned in our
last slides like math Boolean
string okay date they're all basically
predefined objects are available under
those objects these methods are actually
available like date if you can see it
will dis playay the current date and
time concat to concat two different type
of string push some adding some new
records into your array pop to remove
round to do the round length to
calculate the length of the string so
these are all some well-known methods or
frequently used methods available in
JavaScript now what different type of
Scopes available in JavaScript for the
variables now so Scopes are basically
designed to give you the visibility
within your program okay so different
type of Scopes are available one is
called a global scope so Global scope is
having the availability within a file
anywhere else you can access this
particular code or particular variable
that is called Global scope and local
Scopes are those Scopes which are
accessible within a function and hence
cannot be accessed by any other function
or outside of this function so two
standard type of Scopes which are
available here now what is the this
keyword in JavaScript this means to
refer the current
object okay so whenever you see the this
keyword it is designed to refer the
current object in JavaScript so we
typically Define the this keyword to
assign the value to my current object
properties usually this is a place where
that this keyword is mostly
used now what are the conventions of
giving the names to the variables okay
so some standard naming convention which
we should always follow but few things
as you remember there are certain
Reserve keywords are there in JavaScript
which you cannot offer while giving the
names to your variables or to your
functions like if I can say War let cons
and many more which are there available
which you cannot assign to your any
existing variable provided or functions
under your
JavaScript
now here they are trying to say variable
names cannot begin with any numeric
value like you cannot give VAR with ABC
so not ABC I would say rather 1 2 3 or
something like that so there must be a
combination of I would say integer as
well as a character okay so they must
only begin with letter or underscore
characters it is the same like as we
have it in Java also now naming
conventions are very very important
JavaScript is a case sensitive hence the
small a and capital A have two different
meanings for the JavaScript so that part
needs to be well taken care
of now what is a call back in JavaScript
so you need to understand the call back
in JavaScript is a kind of function
which you're passing as an parameter to
the another function to
execute okay so callbacks are mainly
designed to tell your application that
they need to wait rather than continue
to execute so callbacks will help you to
behave asynchronously and that's what
exactly this is most valuable feature of
JavaScript so as I discussed already so
it is where the function needs to be
passed to get executed so how do you
debug a JavaScript code so to debug your
JavaScript code in any browser you can
just press the F12 no matter which
browser you have it either Chrome or
Firefox or anyone you can just press the
F12 key and there you can get this
option called debugger where you can
just go and perform all the necessary
debugging related stuff right over there
or so many other editors like in sublim
text Visual Studio code atom they're all
offering you the building support to
debug your JavaScript
code now what is the difference between
a function declaration and function
expression so there's a very very simple
difference so when you say function ABC
here okay so you declare as a separate
statement within the same JavaScript
code okay in another example what you do
you define a function within a variable
name called a which you can create to
construct some another object for this
that's the only difference between these
two so this function can be called
before the function is defined and this
will be created when the function is
pointing and reaching it okay so it can
be used only after that so that's what
we have discussed now going forward this
offers the better code readability and
better code organization
and that the other part is basically
used to create a conditional all or
Declaration
functions so what are the ways of adding
the JavaScript code in an HTML file so
there are uh I would say two ways are
available one either you can declare it
in a separate file you can add it or
second you can write a embedded
JavaScript code where you can just write
a JavaScript code either in your head
tag or body tag but there'll be one
difference like if you're writing it as
an embedded JavaScript you cannot use it
for the different HTML file with the
internal Javascript file will be limited
to that HTML however external Javascript
will be more useful when you want to
reuse it again and
again so these were some standard basic
JavaScript questions for us so let's go
ahead and talk about something which is
related to your intermediate questions
in JavaScript now so what do you
understand about theod cookies so the
cookies are basically a kind of a small
text file okay which is kept in your
browser and contains information about
your client
activities okay so whenever the client
is accessing your websites these
websites can track your activities
through this particular cookies okay so
they just basically record your general
behaviors like what you're doing with
your website so that accordingly they
can give you the better recommendations
now how you going to create a cookie in
your JavaScript so creating a cookie
cookie is one of the property available
under your document object so that you
can create it using document.cookie and
give a key so your all Cookie are stands
with your key and value pair so you have
a key you have a value pair so how you
going to read the cookie so cookie you
can read by the help of the same
property called document. cookie and
here you can just use this
statement like what key and value pair
so whatever the keys you have defined
similar key will be reading it to give
the value of whatever option you want to
read it now how you going to delete the
cookie so cookie can be deleted it very
easily by calling this delete cookie
function where you can just tell about
the time and duration when you want the
cookie to be get deleted so when you set
the expiry time so cookies are deleted
after specific period of time that will
be treated as a good programming
practice so what is the difference
between a let and V keyword see there's
a new feature which is there added
called let keyword which is known as
called Block Level scope the Block Level
scope means your variable whichever
you're defining under any Block Level
statement will be limited to that
particular block like if you're defining
it any opening block and closing block
BL so beyond that you cannot see that
suppose if you're defining it under if
block or any block so these type of
variables are no longer accessible
outside where the V keyword will be
typically treated as a global variable
and hence it can be accessed
anywhere so what is the closure in
JavaScript so closure is basically going
to give you u a better way of providing
the consistent way of developing a
JavaScript code for the developer so
closures are basically created whenever
a variable that is defined outside of
this current scope can be exist within
the current scope okay that means which
is a variable which is defined outside
of the scope even using the scope of
this particular closure it can be
accessed inside to now what are the
arrow functions in JavaScript friends
Arrow function in JavaScript is very
very popular now they're just going to
give you a kind of Al alterative way of
defining the function keyword these are
the just a shortcut way of defining the
function in JavaScript these are simple
handy functions I would
say so what are the difference ways of
HTM can be accessed in JavaScript course
so there are multiple ways are there so
you can access using document. get
element by class name you can access get
element by ID you can get access
document get element by tag name and you
can say document. query selector so
these are the multiple options are there
through which you can access the
element within your HTML tags what are
the ways of defining a variable so War
keyword as we discussed you can define a
variable you can also Define the
variable using const so if you define
any variable using const so these
variables will get constantly declared
and it cannot be changed once you define
the value so any value or any variable
which is defined using con it cannot be
changed in later
reaches what are Imports and export in
JavaScript so to make your JavaScript
modular so there's an option available
of importing and exporting it so what
exactly the difference difference is
very simple like you are writing the set
of JavaScript code and if you want to
get it accessed outside in another
Javascript file so how the two
JavaScript files can communicate with
each other that is where exactly the
important export code comes to make your
JavaScript highly reused and more
modular now these are the quick example
as you can see now two different files
are there so if you want to make your
particular
variable or function accessed outside
you always use export keyword with them
and if you want to access them out you
can just use an import keyword as you
can see it is defined there so another
file can easily access your the content
of the previous files to make your code
even more modular and
useful so what is the difference between
a document and window in JavaScript see
document is the one which is a part of
your document part which user can
actually see that okay so the document
object is the object which falls under
the category of window window is a top
level object so in JavaScript we have
option avable name called Bo that is
called browser object model in which the
top level object which is there that is
called window and under this we have a
called document so whatever you see
under your browser it is a part of your
document so what are the some JavaScript
Frameworks and their uses see JavaScript
Frameworks are mainly useful to make
your application more organized with
less code and without getting into into
the detail okay so having this
particular framework will give you the
opportunity so that developer can use
the JavaScript in much more better way
to write a complex code in more
simplified manner this is where exactly
your Frameworks are designed for so
there are some very prominent and useful
Frameworks like a react angular VJs and
lot many other names are there in Market
which will be using this JavaScript as a
core and take the entire JavaScript
development to the next level so the
next question is what is the difference
between a undefined and Undeclared in
JavaScript see it is very simple
undefined means the variable which is
undefined you're declaring a
variable okay and which you haven't
defined okay that means the variable has
been declared but the value has not yet
assigned that is called undefined
Undeclared means the variable which
you're trying to that itself is not
available it doesn't even exist so what
is the difference between undefined and
null in JavaScript see undefined as I
already told you it means the variable
has been declared but it is not assigned
with any value null is actually the
assignment value that we can assign to
any variable which contain no values as
an alternative I would say so what is
the difference between session storage
and local storage see it is very simple
HTML 5 has offered this features to you
so so the session storage and loal
storage both offers you the data which
can be stored in a browser but session
storage is shortlived the moment your
page is deleted or closed the session
data is immediately get deleted whether
local storage data is remain for the
longer period of time and the data
doesn't get deleted after the browser
history is over okay so I would say the
local storage time span is far bigger
compared to the session storage okay
everyone so we'll have some Advanced
JavaScript questions now we've already
seen the beginner level as well as the
intermediate level questions now it's
time to discuss about some advanced
level questions too like the first
questions like comes like how do you
empty an array in JavaScript so it is
very simple if you want to
assign so there are few ways are there
number one by assigning the array length
to what to the zero so automatically
turns to empty second is what by
assigning the completely empty array
Okay the third will be by popping up all
the elements of the
array so multiple options are there and
the last which you talk about called by
using the splice function so these are
the four important aspects are there
which you can treat how to empty your
JavaScript array in a very very
simplified manner now what is the
difference between event capturing and
event bubbling see this is one of the
very very common question we talk about
called even capturing even capturing is
actually the kind of process where you
just try
to capture the event of most outermost
element and then propagating it to the
innermost element so even capturing is
what like you're talking about picking
up the element or picking up the event
from the outermost like you talk about
what called nested div tags so you pick
up the particular you know even from the
most outer most div tag and you're just
passing it to the innermost that is
called capturing the bubbling is the
process okay which starts with the
innermost and goes to the outermost
element is just an opposite direction
that is called event
bubbling so the question is one of the
very very popular like what is the
strict mode in JavaScript see the strict
mode of JavaScript is introduced to give
the more better error handling capacity
of the JavaScript so whenever you talk
about call strict mode so all variables
have to be declared explicitly so you
cannot leave it like that and it cannot
be assigned to the readon properties so
we can enable the strict mode only by
adding the US strict mode on the top of
the Javascript file now what about and
how we would be able to get the
following output of the below JavaScript
code so we have a call V AAL to 10
and we have written one function in the
if block and after that we just
capturing the value of a and then you
are printing the value in a
console.log so what would be the out
output for that See it'll be a call 10
undefined once again it'll be kind of
what it'll be undefined how come it
would be look at is very simple first
thing okay in your
application you are basically saying the
if condition statement in the code will
evaluate the eval function as you know
it very well what exactly the evaluation
is later on the eval function okay we'll
take the function and return the
function ABC whatever the function it is
available and then inside the if
statement it execute the ABC and returns
undefined because as you know it
veryable the if statement code executed
run time was the statement inside this
if condition is being evaluated so
that's where exactly it is next can you
write the JavaScript code for adding the
new element in a dynamic manner yes
exactly you can write it down so you
have this very common function available
name document. create element like
people say like I want to add the new
text boxes when I click on the button
so I can write it very well so either it
will be a text box or it will be the new
element you want to add it so document.
create element is one of the very very
common I would say the function and
later on you can use the typical Dom
functions like I can talk about create
next node or upend child so using this
combination you can easily do
so next what is the difference between
call and apply very common question so
the call method whatever the method you
have it in a call these method arguments
are provided individually okay along
with the this value but in apply what
happens arguments are provided in the
form of array along with this value that
is the only difference between call and
apply so what would be the output of the
below JavaScript code as you can see
right now we have written one object
name called student provided one
property called college with ABC after
that you're saying object. create
passing this a student as an object
itself and after that you're saying
delete student 1. College in console.
log
student. so what would be the value for
this so it is very simple it is very
simple example of object orientation so
the output will be what ABC as we
accessing the property of student object
so certainly the value will be what ABC
for sure now what would be the output
for below JavaScript code as you can see
now we have written a one function f and
it is return 11 so we are saying type of
f so this will certainly refer to what
to the error reason is why because a
function definition can have only single
reference variable as its name that's
why exactly it'll be throwing what an
error to you how do you remove the
duplicate value from the JavaScript
array it is very simple we have a called
filter function so the filter method I
can basically call it and three
arguments it may be expecting it the
name of the array the current element
and the index of the current element so
that it it can remove all the duplicate
elements from there so how do you remove
the duplicate elements from JavaScript
array so it the same way I told you like
first it takes three parameters so using
the filter method and by using the for
Loop so the empty array is used for
sorting all the repeating elements so
like that you can simply make it more
easy so how can you draw a simple
JavaScript Dom so you can say it is a
very simple JavaScript Elements which
are there where you can have the
document and then the HTML and followed
by all child elements like in head tag
body tag body may contain further child
elements like an anchor tag so these all
basically known as called a
presentational elements through which
this complete HTML hierarchy will
contain inside
this what is there inside for you so we
have one very common topic for the
version control system that is called a
git second second we have a called HTML
5 third it's all about CSS 3 then we
talk about JavaScript then we have a
reactjs followed by angular and generic
interview
questions
these six very important topics are used
in web development so people expect that
you are aware about some very common
questions which they usually ask so
let's get
started so we are going to talk about
Version Control System first what do you
understand with version control system
so as we know it very well today when we
talk about call uh a kind of team which
work in different environment different
computers so they want to store their
work in a centralized repository system
okay so that they can keep track of what
they have done so that they can
understand who have made the updates and
when to roll back in case if some
problem comes up so you would like to
push all the necessary repositories to
the centralized system that is called
version control system so it is telling
you it is a system that keeps track all
the necessary changes made to a file or
a set of data okay so it ensures that
everyone work on a most recent system
okay while taking care about your
necessary
updates next what is the difference
between a centralized and distributed
version control system so as we know it
very well when we talk about call a
centralized system okay so in
centralized system what happens like
here it uses the centralized server to
store all different version of files
usually we always commit those changes
to our local system but in centralized
system it helps to protect in case of
any failure happens in your local
environment so it can easily
protect okay so developer doesn't need
to save any file local to their
system okay so the main idea is to
basically avoid single point foil over
and keep everything under the single
location now when it comes to the second
option called distributed version
control system so what they're trying to
say that every developer has a copy of
all the versions while developing a code
so it actually improves the ability to
work offline and does not rely on the
single locations for the
backup okay so there is no even threat
for Server crashes that's the benefit of
centralized version
system now my next question is like just
explain me the get push and get pull how
they're different and how they are
differentiated from each other so we
know it very well when we talk about
like a get push so push is trying to
commit okay some changes whichever are
made into the local file system to the
centralized
repository okay so whichever Cloud
environment you will be using it it
could be either GitHub or else you talk
about bit bucket or else you talk about
gitlab so you would like to push all
those necessary changes to that location
and pull on the other hand is
responsible to pull to retrieve all
those version controlling to your local
envirment clear that's the benefit and
that's the difference which
comes okay now going ahead and talk
about the G pull as I said that you try
to
fetch the real data from your local
repository okay to towards your local
repository whichever is there available
in your Cloud environment so we say the
git pull is a combinations of two
command git fetch followed by the git
merge okay so now next question give us
a few git commands and their
functions okay so there are few commands
which are there the first command is
like in git config so in git config you
basically configure your username and
email address that is really helpful
whenever you would like to
push the repositories in your Cloud
environment get in is to initialize a g
repository get add is to basically add
the files to the staging
areas get diff to view the changes made
to this particular file and we have
called get commit okay commit means what
the changes to the head but not to the
report or to the remote
repositories now there other commands
are also avilable like in git reset
which is designed to undo all the
changes whichever we have made to the
git repository we also have a called git
status to know about the current state
of the working directory and the staging
area we talk about like in get merge
okay so that means that you want to
merge a branch okay into a active
Branch so get push so this is the
command through which you will be upload
the content from the local repository to
the remote repository get pull
is to basically Fetch and download the
content from the remote
repositories now next thing uh the
difference between git pull and the git
fetch so when we talk about like in git
fetch so git fetch is only downloads new
data from a report remote repository
okay so it does not integrate any of its
new data into your working files okay so
git command or git fetch can be done at
any point of time to update the remote
tracking branches clear that is a git
fetch on the other side when we talk
about called gitp so gitp updates the
current head Branch with the latest
changes from the remote
servers okay so the git pull downloads
the new data and integrates with the
current working directory files so it
actually tries to merge the remote
changes with your local ones so that's
the difference between get get fetch and
the get pull
so the next question comes here is what
is the merge conflict in git and how it
can be resolved see the merge conflict
is very very common when you have the
common data is
available between the branches and in
that point of time which one to take
which one to avoid so in such kind of
scenario the conflict automatically
comes
in clear now so you actually does what
you go back and manually edit the file
and decide which particular portion you
would like to to keep and which other
portion you would like to discard so
that how the G merge conflict you try to
utilize it now when we talk about the
git merge conflict how it can be
resolved so we have a called pull
request which is available under the
repository name when you click it there
so in pull request actually you click to
pull the request with a merge conflict
which you would like to resolve so it
need so in the near bottom of your pull
request the click resolve conflicts so
you decide which one to keep which one
to basically avoid so that something
which really make your life even more
simple to avoid the confliction or in
case in confliction comes how to
basically fix that
up okay so you can see now this kind of
messages like in greater than less than
and hyphen equal to sign this would be
shown at a time of resolve okay so you
basically decide which one you want to
take it so if you have more than one
merge conflict in your file you just
scroll down to the next set of conflict
markers and repeat the steps okay for
four and five resolve the merge conflict
will be taken care and once it is
resolved it'll click as a result which
will be ready to get update to your
existing Branch that's how exactly the
merge conflict is really made
up now so once you have resolved all the
merge you you can see the green color
signal that says like okay there's no
confliction available or no more
conflict in your program so you can
simply merge the entire base Branch into
the head Branch okay so to merge your
pull request you click merge pull
request okay so get merge conflict it
arises when you have a multiple branches
when they are trying to merge with each
other so there are some common set of
data or files which will be available in
both the side so in that point of time
it needs to
be avoid confliction so that's how it
really
works so how you can resolve it so you
can also resolve the merge conflict
using command line so you simply open a
g bash and go to this particular
repository where the merge conflict is
actually occurred and then it generates
the list of files which are actually
affected by the conflict so in this
particular example you can see there's a
one style guide. MD file which has a got
merge conflict so you basically shoot up
some command okay so you open it any any
editor like in vs code editor atom so
you go to that location open this
particular
file and Manu plate and decide which one
you really want and likewise you'll be
in position to resolve all the conflict
and discard all those changes whichever
you're not interested
in okay so that's how the merge conflict
is already taken care
of okay so what you're doing it right
now you are adding your files to the
stages by saying get add Dot and after
that you're committing it by using this
commit so now you can merge all the
branches with using push so those
changes okay to your remote repository
on your GitHub and merge your command in
a p
request okay so that was a quick idea
about how you can try to resolve the
issue of git
conflict okay so the next question comes
here that is called what is git stash so
what is a g stash so imagine we are a
developer and he's working with the
current branch and wants to switch the
branch okay to the another
Branch okay to work on something else
just imagine and after that what
happens but you don't want to commit the
changes to your unfinished work because
the changes are not yet decided so you
really don't want to commit those
changes to your unfinished work okay so
the solution is called what is g stash
okay so it basically try to takes your
modified track files and saves it on
your stack of Unfinished changes that
means these are not committed properly
so that you can reapply at any point of
time that is called git stash so what is
the difference between get merge and git
rebase these are very common question
see suppose it says you are working on a
new feature of your project and in a
dedicated branch and another team
members updates the master Branch with
some new
commits okay and what is happening now
so to incorporate the new commits into
your feature Branch like you have
already initiated one job and your team
members have already initiated the job
in a parallel branch and you feel okay
you want to merge both the features
together okay so what you will do so
you're going to create a extra merge
commit every time you need to
incorporate changes so to pollute your
feature Branch histories so here what is
happening now as an alternative to
merging see as an altern native to
merging you can rebase the feature
Branch into the master so it
incorporates or whatever the changes you
want to incorporate all the new commits
in a master branch number one and it
rewrites the project history by creating
the brand new commits for each commit in
the original Branch that's the
difference between a g merge and the git
rebase so git is as you know it very
well it is designed for the the
centralized repository system and uh
from the remote repository or from the
local repository you can basically try
to update or
retrive whatever number of Records you
want okay so to make it
possible about the git we have
some I would say commands available
like I talk about like in push we talk
about like in pull so what is the
difference see when you talk about like
in push you send the commit and ask them
to update their Branch this actually
requires that things to be right on
their end are we clear and the pull
command on the other hand it is nothing
but to call retrive which is called kind
of fetch which gets the commit and has
your G update to your report or remote
tracking and get you the all latest
updates are we clear now so
let's go ahead and talk about how we
going to be implementing this okay so
first of all I will be going and
creating a new empty repository by
saying kid
space in
it so you can see it is initializing the
empty git repository inside this and now
I would like to create the new file and
keep it
inside okay so if I have uh this file
with me okay I'll put it under this or
any file whichever I want suppose if I
have this
call
uh this okay and I put it under my G
demo okay it is there enter my G demo
now now what I can do I can just use
this statement like
uh get
space status I can see one file and I'm
saying get Space add space Dot and once
again I'm saying get status all files
are now tracked and now I talk
about get Space commit space hyphen
M are we clear now all changed and now I
would like to push this to my main
repository so I have have this command
with me called you know git Branch
hyphen M main as you can see now
so just see the commands here which we
have it because I have a repository
available in my remote location so I can
say get Space
Branch okay space hyphen m space main
that means I want to put it in our main
branch okay so now it is done and I'll
be talking about G remote where I want
to add it so this is the remote location
so I need to make this remote location
available paste
it okay and I can say get Space
push okay hyphen u space
main now you can see it is uploading and
it's saying writing object and the
records has been successfully
taken okay so this is how you're able
to get all those into your application
now you can see we have this react Cas
study. dox is now available to us now we
have an option called pull request are
we clear so what it is saying now we're
going to pull this request okay so I can
just say new pull
request okay so it is telling you
compare and changes the branches across
you want okay so let me go back and
change first of all I go back to my
code which
is get
theem and here whichever the name I have
it
I just
use the file which I have it now I say
get Space
pull
okay and now you can
see it is taking it
up okay now you can see the word is
being taken and that's what the pull is
so P actually calls the G fetch which
gets commits and has your G updates your
remote tracking name and then runs the
second command to update your branch so
the second command can combine the parel
development so this is how the
difference between push and the
pull everyone so now we going to talk
about some of the very very common and
useful commands provided by the git and
their practical usage okay now the First
Command which we always use it with the
git okay that is called git config we
talk about like get config so this
config is basically provide the
configuration because if you want to
push or pull the repository so it should
know about on which username and which
email so we talk about the set the
author name and email address okay with
your commits it is very very essential
okay so whenever you try to perform a
commit it basically keep all the names
and email Associated so we say get
config hyphen
Global and you provide
username and then you provide the
username and in a similar way you
provide the email I just copy and here
you provide what user
Dot and now in space you can give the
username and here you provide what email
second command which we know it very
well that is called get space What in it
that is for initializing the repository
as you have already seen next we talk
about like in git space clone okay which
is responsible to obtain the reposit
repository from the existing URL the one
which you have already taken it up then
you have recently seen the command in my
previous example that is called get
Space add okay space file
name okay or you can use estri estri
means add all the files and file name
will be the specific file you want to to
talk about you've already seen one
command name called what git
space commit which is to commit the
records into your repository we have
also seen get space What status to know
about the current status of my
repository or my you know the statement
like in which particular position it is
it is untagged it is tracked it is
committed so those status I want to know
that clear now so you talk about another
command that is known as called git
space
reset what this command does so this git
reset uh is basically unstage the file
okay unstage means earlier your file was
staged now it is unstaged but
prevents okay or The Preserve the file
contents it doesn't delete those
contents but reset means what it does
reset unstaged when you say talk about
add it staged when you
say reset it unstage but it basically
keep keep all the necessary data within
that are we clear now so these are the
some necessary commands are there comes
along with your G
Point hello everyone so now we're going
to talk about our next very interesting
area of the gate that is know as called
what is a merge conflict and how to
basically resolve that okay see in every
situation where the work can be
paralyzed in every situation and where
the work can be paralyzed will work will
eventually
overlap sometimes two developers will
change the same line of code in two
different ways in such cases git can't
tell which version is correct that time
you have to decide okay so to work with
the merge conflict okay so git gives you
the clue like say like I have got two
updates which one you want to keep it so
that you would like to make it now so to
make it this possible we will be using
the
system now to make it possible I would
like to create one simple example
of avoiding the git merge or sorry the
git conflict so first of all I will
say LS iph L nothing is there so we are
saying get is space in it it'll
initializing the repository LS i l it
would not be showing any you know
the hidden repository which is created
but certainly in my vs code editor I can
see it is created for me that's
perfectly fine let me go back and create
the new file here okay and uh I just
create using
Echo this is new redmi
file okay and the file name will be
what
MD okay you can see this new file has
been created now okay so what I'll be
doing now I can go back and change some
content inside
this okay so first of all let me check
cat
space redme MD I can see this is a new
file with me now I can say get Space add
space
red me. MD okay and after that I can say
get
Space commit space hyphen
M I can say red
me add
it okay you can see now one file changed
and then all all done we just talk about
G
space status it says on Branch Master it
is done okay so that's it it is there
now let's go back and create a new
Branch now so to create a new Branch
what I'll be saying I'll be saying get
Space check out I'm going to create a
new Branch space hyphen B okay and I'm
going to give the name
call
okay Branch to
create
conflict okay so we saying get Space
checkout okay space High B and we're
just giving that name
here okay so we're just saying
so let's check about what is
there okay so we've created
status
conflict and uh the branch will be
created and it'll be shifting out
there so you see like we saying switch
to the new Branch Branch to conflict and
if I want to check by saying get
Space Branch so I can say my current
position is Branch to
conflict okay and below this we have
this a statement to me now what I can
say I can
create uh the changes inside my read me.
file okay so what we can do now here in
this readme.md file I can go back and
change by
saying on
the
branch okay this is an edit on the
branch
and
uh what we can do now we can once again
just
check get
Space get Space status you can see the
file has been modified now and I can
just use get Space
commit okay space hyphen
m space we can give a value
call on
Branch okay now you can
see this is telling you the
change okay so we saying one file change
to
modifications modified but yes we have
haven't add those to make those changes
so we just need to say get Space add
space okay and
then commit it and now you can see one
file change to insertions not is working
because I did not add those and uh once
it is done then we'll be switching back
to our Master Branch so right now read
me. MD have those changes I'll go back
to my master Branch we say
get
checkout
Master you can see if I say get checkout
Master it is having the older data which
is available to us okay and now I can
just make the changes once again here I
can say this
is Master okay now I can call get Space
state
and I can
call get space at
space readme.md
and uh we can just say get
Space commit space hyphen
M updated again in
master okay
and uh you can see it's done but now
when it talk about like a merging that
the challenge will come now if I just
talk about git
space Branch so it is in master Branch
right now so if I want to merge the
master Branch with this Branch so what
I'll be doing now I'll just use this
option like in what get
Space
merge okay and we have a
Branch okay underscore 2
underscore
conflict you can see now conflict came
up are we clear now it is saying Auto
merging it's a conflict content and you
can see immediately it is telling you
they say accept current changes this is
a master and this is an edit are we
clear so at this point of time you have
to decide which one you want to keep and
which one you want to avoid so if you
want to keep the which one that uh on
edit which is done in a child Branch
what you can do you can basically keep
those okay and let those changes will be
done by your
application okay so now when I
say I can
say
okay and that's it so this is how
exactly the merge conflict is taking
place okay everyone so now you can tell
which other file you want to make so
that's how the final file which is
available to you and that's the beauty
of what the conflict changes I hope
you're all
clear okay so the G interview questions
are over now we are heading towards and
HTML interview questions now here are a
few questions like what is an attribute
in HTML so you can consider the
attribute are the properties that can be
added into the HTML tag and that changes
the way the tag behaves or it is
displayed okay so you can see here you
have a call Button okay so attributes
are added right after the name of the
HTML tag so button is an element for me
it's not an attribute Okay so what is a
marku in an HTML file so marku is
something which keep on rotating okay
let
say for scrolling down the text Page or
the text on the web page Mark is used
sometimes you might have seen when you
want to display some very important
information okay which needs to scroll
at the bottom or else the right after
specific period of time you always use
marku it is one of the very very
old element available under the HTML
page so it Scrolls the image top left
right center automatically everywhere so
you always use Maru tags for rotating
it so the next is what is the semantic
and HTML see semantics or htmls are
nothing but to call another coding style
okay
so when you talk about a semantics so
they are basically reinforcing the
meaning of the contents like typically
you have seen we are using div and span
tag but a div and span tag really don't
make sense to us as an HTML reviewer
unless I go inside those and get to know
about what they're really doing it so
semantics are nothing but these are the
standard tags are we clear so you can
see like here like bold tag is not
useful for the Bold statement as well as
the italic tag is used for for what for
the italic tag so instead of we are
using strong and EM tags are we clear
now so this makes more sense to
us now the next thing is how do you
display a table in an HTML web page so
obviously we have a got table tag and
under the table tag I can or align the
complete layout of my web page because
of table head table body table row table
columns there are multiple different
type of elements which are available
okay which are the part of table it just
to basically align the content in a
proper
format
what is SVG okay so SVG is basically
known as a kind of a graphic which is
written in a typical XML language the
svgs are the high quality Graphics which
doesn't tear off when you basically grow
and increase or Zoom so normally what
happens JF image you talk about jpeg
images after Beyond certain point that
pixel get data Ori created but here in
SVG it never happens so you go to any
level when you want to zoom and you're
going to get accurate contents at any
point of
time okay so these vector graphics are
really typical 2D base diagrams and give
you the X and Y coordinates in a regular
systems next how do you separate a
section of text in HTML to separate a
sections of text in HTML we always use
what either
BR or else we use block code or else we
use what a paragraph tag so BR means
anyways it separate out a
text and break the current line
paragraph is used to again write a
paragraph of text and the block quotes
is used to define the large quoted
sections okay next is how do you create
the nested web page in HTML so obviously
we have a different different type of
options are available like an if
frame okay you me to say page within a
web page okay so we can create a page
within a web page with using iframe so
this are very very common questions we
use
to receive at a time of
interview okay the difference between
ordered list and unordered list so
ordered list will give you the different
ways to display the
data in Roman format in numeric digits
or else you can talk about like an
alphabetical order but the unordered
list completely unordered you don't get
any options like an ordered
list okay so the ordered list start with
O and unordered list starts with
UL um in our HTML demos I'm going to
start with very first file that is known
as called table
demo like how we can offer you the table
related tags inside the HTML so table as
we know it very well it is designed to
organize your contents or give you the
proper layout so it is a very old
Technique we are using to align or to
Pro Define a proper layout so this HTML
page will start working with the very
first tag that is called table within
this table we'll be using TR that is
called table row under this table row
we'll be using th called table heading
and inside this table heading we're
going to give
call name like this I
copy and here we
say uh employee name I
say F or I can say name City and we can
say
Department three parameters I have it
now soal three different headings and uh
these headings are getting closed and
we're going to start start working with
another table row and here we'll be
providing the data so again another TR
again we'll be having this TD in this DD
we can say admin this will be the first
attribute we're going to use this called
admin followed by another
properties we
say
admin
mail.com Department I can say
HR or we'll try to copy this again and
have few more rows I can
say now I can say admin I can say
Atul here we
say okay so here we can
say Finance so this is going to give me
the data soal what table data so we're
giving TD so here let me see how the
outcome will be so
Linder there we go now you can see it's
going to give me the proper look and
feel for how the table really looks like
in so that's a quick example of table
but yes if you want to organize a table
little bit more better are we clear so
thus you can apply some of the styles on
the top of that like as you can see here
we called table so we can just use in
life style that is called style equal to
float colon
right if I do
so I will see some difference you can
see it is on right hand side by default
it will be on left
or there's no
Center no nothing it'll be either
left float left okay so like this you're
going to offer the table so that is a
very simple example of like how the
table can be created within your
HTML next after this table we going to
go ahead uh with some new ideas well if
in case if you want to make this table
even more attractive we have some
options with us by offering some Styles
this example we'll be seeing it in a
upcoming Demos in a CSS so that is the
table demo which we have recently seen
going ahead we'll be talking about like
in how we can offer you the SVG scalar
vector graphics that is there a feature
under added under the HTML 5.0 so how
you'll be adding it let's take a
look let me add a new file called
SVG demo. HTML here let me add a
template and here onwards we'll be
adding this SVG so SVG itself is a
tag okay so we using this SVG here and
this SVG we have to provide uh some
standard width and height so we
say width equal to 100 and we just say
height equal
to 100 that we are providing with the
SVG
here if I try to see the
outcome because it would not show right
now but certainly we can add it and see
what we can apply over here so we have a
called SVG let me add the first property
called
Circle okay
so in this circle we'll be offering the
x and y coordinate so we can say CX
equal to I can say
50 x okay and uh we also use
Cy equal to once again 50 and uh
followed by R radius equal
to the way you want So within this I'll
be offering the stroke the surrounding
part but let's see you can see it
automatically came the best part is like
if you expand or Zoom at whatever level
it won't go down and that's a beauty
okay and here we can attach the some
color Strokes whichever you want to give
it here that we can give it
so here we say
stroke okay and
uh this is a circle so we would like to
offer the other properties so this will
be the stroke for me so rather than
writing a
separate I can better attach it
here stroke equal to you can just say uh
black and we can use this option like in
stroke
withd stroke
hyphen width equal to you can give three
and followed by you can use
fill color which you would like to make
it so I can just say
pink like
this okay that's it let's check awesome
this looks beautiful that is one of the
basic example of like how you can use
this
SVG okay so now we're going to talk
about our next feature in a same
continuation to the HTML I'm going to
talk about something called how you'll
be separating it out the the sections of
HTML page see HTML page comes with loads
and loads of data now how you'll be
separating it out now how you'll be
arranging it properly to tell like okay
this particular section contains this
related data so in HTML 5 we have one
beautiful feature comes that is known as
called semantics it is a feature of HTML
5 that not only helps the Google that is
which we talk about called search engine
optimization that's called SEO but also
so to make the developers life even more
easier to understand the contents what
is there beneath so let's go ahead and
talk about our next feature called how
you going to be separating it out so
this not is called semantics so we're
going to talk about
called okay semantics.
HTML here we will start working with the
same
HTML tags with us so here we will start
working with the the data so we always
have some predefined tags
called call header okay I can say this
is header and after this we have a
call footer can say this is footer so
this is how you can see more meaningful
we talk about like a
nav you see like it is a nav we can say
this is
menu
nav okay along with this navigation we
can also offer call
section okay so under the sections you
can have an articles okay so we can
say uh under the sections let's talk
about
call article so article we can say this
is article
one okay and uh we can say this is
article two and we can create n number
of sections in my code okay and uh after
that we can
have summary okay which can defines
the for details elements so like there
are lot many available lot many are
available so if you can just take a look
to the semantics you really won't find
any difference but
yes it is a separators okay so used
heavily insert HTML based applications
so that's how you are defining the
separators into your code so it looks
more even uh easy to understand what is
there under so that's how we Define this
layouts well coming to the next area of
our HTML we're going to talk about
something called how you going to be
defining okay a nested HTML page so
nested HTML page we have a feature that
means page interage so that's called
iframe iframe is a feature okay that
helps the user to define the page under
the page and how do we use that let's
take a look so under the body
section okay I will be offering iframe
okay so I can just use use
H3 I
say iframe demo and within this I'll be
using iframe tag you can say iframe SRC
equal to I can just give the name of
Simply learn so you can just go
ahead sorry spelling wrong so you can
just see the simply learn.com that is a
website so I can just copy
this okay and uh off for this iframe SRC
equal to https simply
learn.com okay and uh that's it so we
have a call frame border I really do not
want a frame border if you want you can
just add the initial value clear and you
can talk about called style in the same
level okay so you can just
say style in style you can also offer
some other type of details too okay
let's see we use it so here we are
talking about our style part so style
you can just say height so height you
can Define how much height you want so I
can just say uh 300
pixels okay and also we can offer the
width
so width I can say again 300
pixels so these are the properties are
there let's check how it really looks
like it so here in our listed now you
can see we have got this
uh simply refuse to connect because of
some you know connection issues so it
works but you can see like how it is
showing you uh in your application to
have a quick
look okay so that's an an idea like how
the iframes are used inside your code
okay so you can also offer some other
type of tools like you can say
here
uh if I say
google.com see it going to show you like
this okay because of security issues it
is not if I just go to the inspect area
we can see console they say cross origin
same origin so this issues normally
comes okay but anyways that is how I
told you to use this frames into your
code well going to the next area of this
HTML that's called defining the list now
this is once again very interesting area
of uh HTML okay where you're going to
get the different set of uh display if
you want to display the data in the form
of list so if you have in form of array
you want to display this in a form of
list you can certainly get it so HTML
has got inbu tags available for the list
two different type of tags are available
one is called ordered list and second
called unordered list ordered list
always starts with
o yeah it always starts with o called
ordered list under this we'll be using
Li that stand for list items so you can
give the items like I'm talking about
like in
soap okay and uh another one I can just
take called
mobiles next we are talking
about machines so that is called ordered
list so this ordered list going to give
you the idea of like how the data really
looks like and you can see
now okay and this also you can
change look okay while using
this type equal to options are there
like you want to have a numbering which
is the by default option if you want to
use
alphabetical you can see it is showing
the alphabetical Roman numbers that is
called audit list the other hand we have
this option like an UL called unordered
list and on this unordered list you
won't get any kind of sequences but yes
the data would be available to us but
there'll be no sequence kept in so here
this is called
UL
yeah unordered list let's check now you
can see the only diss are coming up but
there's no
exactly the types okay so that is a
quick difference between the ordered
list and unordered list provided by HTML
to
us okay so we have already seen the
difference between ordered list and
unordered list now it's time to talk
about our another typ type of interview
questions which is regards to your CSS
now in CSS interview the first question
they always ask you like how do you add
CSS styling in
HTML so we are different ways to include
number one we have a called inline CSS
where we use the element and within that
we try to add the CSS content that is
called inline CSS second is called
external
stylesheet okay where you can just use
as a secondary or the you know external
CSS file and just include it into your
existing HTML page okay that is a
additional file which you write it in a
CSS and you include it in HTML and third
is called which is the internal
stylesheet which you write it within
your HTML but the only difference
happens when you talk about external it
is reusable across multiple web
pages now the different type of CSS
selectors which are available so we have
a different selectors like a universal
selector which is available we use asri
sign and select all the elements and
offer the common style second we talk
about element type selector where you
have the specific element name into your
mind and you offer that particular type
of selector ID selector is responsible
to select the particular element with is
having the proper
ID class selector which starts with a
DOT
class okay and having the class name we
talk about decient selector so desent
selector you basically try to select all
the elements which are the part of that
okay so you are selecting this container
and under that all the child elements of
the Box okay so we talking about like in
what of your disident selector we talk
about called child combinator so in this
case you are basically trying to select
all those which is the child of this
container so you are using this greater
than symbol of container dobox okay so
selecting all those which are having the
child name called Box available then
you're talking about a general sibling
selectors with this Tinder sign and
finally we talk about like an attribute
selector where you have a proper
attribute available to
you okay so these are known as called a
general CSS selectors followed by we
have a next question like in what is SAS
less and stylus friends these are the
advanced level of CSS used in the
industry so we talk about like it what
is a SAS which we talk about like in
statically awesome style sheet so we
also have a similar type of option like
in list and many more okay so it says
about the SAS saying that it is a Sy
statically awesome style sheet it is
basically taking the complete CSS to the
next
level so that is a third party website
but once again it is very awesome CSS
which can offer you the mathematical
functions as well as the reusability you
talk about less okay so we talk about
linear style sheet where you can see all
statements which starts with ADD theate
sign there inas every single variable
start with the dollar
sign then you talk about stylus it also
a flexible CSS so it doesn't use atate
or dollar for any defining variables we
can just directly use this with the name
okay and use it at any point of time so
these are the three very popular new or
next Generation
CSS so explain box sizing property like
how you can offer the property for the
Box
sizing so here so box sizing property
actually defines how to basically Define
height and the width of the box which
are calculated so you talk about a term
name called content box you talk about
padding box and you talk about border
box typically we use three different
type of box content padding and Border
box in a Content box these are the
default width and the height which can
apply to the elements content which are
there under the content box okay padding
box are here you talk about the
dimensions which are added to the Box
elements of the content
padding third which is available called
but box so here the dimensions added to
the content padding and the
Border now what are the difference way
to hide the element in a CSS so we have
a different way either we can use
display none that means whatever is
there inside the Dom it won't be visible
to
you second option is visibility hidden
that is another property through which
you
can eliminate the visibility but the
thing is like it is not visible to the
user but this element is added to the
Dom and takes up the space but but in
display none it doesn't load in a Dom so
somewhere to when you want to talk about
performance display none is anytime
better and second call position absolute
so this can be made to the appear
outside the screen so three different
options are
available next option what does that
important CSS mean so the important
keyword actually indicates that the
highest precedence and it overrides the
cascet
properties okay so like as you can see
here we have a called paragraph where we
have a color called important and
there's one ID name called thing color
called Green so when we talk about P ID
equal to what thing so it automatically
triy to override the highest
precedence okay now what are the CSS
Sprites CSS Sprites is a technique where
you can basically take uh
larger image okay download in a single
shot and try to cut down the pieces and
utilize the way you always
want okay so if you're using this small
small images
separately okay so to load those images
independently you would be making
multiple HTTP calls which can be an
overhead so it is good to basically
download this uh lengthy image in a
single shot clear and utilize them as
per your convenience within your
application so it is used to minimize
the loading time of your web page by
combining multiple smaller picture into
the single
image okay that's what the CSS Sprites
are so which properties used to
underline and strike through and the
overline text so we have this option Tex
stle text type text decoration text
transform okay so the text decoration so
the text decoration is the one which
will be helping you to achieve this so I
would like to demonstrate some of the
CSS related features the very first
feature is like how many ways are there
to add CSS inside your code so here I'll
be creating the new file name called
index
HTML okay how many ways are there there
to
add a CSS into your code so there are
three different ways are there okay the
number one which is known as called
external CSS internal CSS and inline CSS
external CSS means you have some CSS
features externally used and that you
want to make it available locally okay
let's take a look here I'm going to
create the new file under the CSS demo
that is known as call
styles. CSS and here we can write some
normal Styles like I can talk about
body in this body we can just say
background color equal to let's say
pink okay and I want to include this
inside my local environment so here in
my head section I would like to
use
Link okay so you can see we have an
options available name called link r
equal to style shet hrf equal to style
but my class name is Styles let's say
styles. CSS and check how it works
so
here you can see now the background
color is changed to what to Pink that is
called external CSS the best part of the
external CSS is to give you the
reusability factor so if any other HTML
file want to use the same style it can
be easily used second called internal
stylesheet internal stylesheet means
you'll be having or some some of them
say it is a kind of embedded stylesheet
where you have the Styles available
locally and that starts with style tag
here you define suppose
H1 and in this H1 suppose if I say color
I'm saying
suppose blue and here we defining the
H1
okay I'm saying welcome
to heading and if I just
try you can see now this internal
stylesheet is utilized here that is
known as called internal or embedded
stylesheet and the third which is known
as called inline stylesheet where you
offer the style okay to the element
itself which is uh uh I say try to avoid
uh it is not recommended to use because
it you know you lose out the meaning of
elements completely so we just use this
statement like in what
text suppose we talk about text so with
this we'll be using this is style tag
equal
to text align and if I just use Center
so you will see here so all three styles
are applicable in the same page that is
called internal stylesheet that is
called inline stylesheet and this is
known as called external stylesheet so
I'm sure we got the idea about how the
three stylesheets are utilized
together well going ahead and uh taking
you towards another very interesting
area of our CSS called different type of
CSS selectors see ultimate goal of CSS
is
what to apply the style on your target
elements okay so in CSS we have multiple
type of ways to select your
elements in CSS it is known as called
CSS
selectors okay so CSS selectors are used
to select the content where you want the
style to be applied okay so there are
multiple type of selectors are available
first type of selector you've already
seen that is called element
selector that is called what element
selector another type of option which is
available that is known as called ID
selector that means if I have a one
H3 content with me and I can say this
is heading three and if I want to
utilize here call S3 and I say what
class equal to give the name I can just
say um
S3 demo just a name you can give any
name here if I just use with DOT keyword
I say
H3 demo and here if I want to apply the
style I can say
color aqua that means it will be
applicable only on those particular
classes which color equal to what EA
let's take a look there you
go okay so you got to know this is know
as called what CSS selector another
option which is available called ID
selector that means similar elements can
be now access through help of IDs like
if I remove this class and if I use ID
equal to S3 demo so you don't use dot
you rather use what
hash okay and give the color the way you
want suppose if I want to talk about
like
an blue violet so now you will see it
looks like
this okay so that called ID selector so
element selector we have seen class
selector we have seen ID selector we
have seen now we talk about Universal
selector Universal selector means what
that means all elements will be selected
like it starts with estri and I
say
align text align Center if I see that
means all the elements will be aligned
to the center as you can see now all
elements are aligned to the center that
means whichever element we declare it
even if I declare paragraph tag here I
say this
is par it will equally applicable to
this paragraph too you can see now it is
also coming to the center that is called
Universal
selectors last which is called group
selector where you can have Elements
which can be grouped together like I
guess I can see H1 and if you want to
apply the similar style for
H1 as well as for the H4 so you can just
use what
H1
H4 okay they'll be sharing the same
feature now so if I just use this
H4 this
is heading
four
now
well now you can see both headings are
now sharing the common feature this
concept is known as called group
selectors where you can select the group
of elements together which you want so
we I told you about element selector
where you target the specific element I
ID selector with the ID attribute class
means you always use with the ID class
ID when you talk about Universal you
talk about s you talk about group
selector you're trying to tell the group
of elements which you want to utilize it
together so these are the quick benefits
and the ways how we Define
it okay thank
you okay so now we will be talking about
our next feature okay in this CSS that
is known as called what is the
difference between or how many ways are
there to hide the
elements okay how many ways are there to
hide elements so there are two options
are available in CSS to hide the
elements number one is called display
none and second is called visibility
hidden okay now let me try to show you
this examples so as of now I'm removing
this uh all records whichever is there
in the style and removing it all okay
now let's make it very simple so it is
called like hiding the elements we have
two options either we can use display
none or else we can use visibility
hidden so display none removes the
element from the normal flow of the page
are we clear and uh visibility hidden
leaves the element in the normal flow
are we clear but occupies a space in a
Dom that means it would not be showing
the elements in your browser but behind
the scene it'll take the
space so it'll be quite heavy so display
none is a better option compared to the
visibility hidden both options are
designed to hide elements let me show
you very simple example here so first
statement what I'm trying to do is here
um I'm defining this
uh ex1 and this ex1 we using this a
space href equal
to Hash okay and we're using style okay
in style we are saying display colon
none so I won't be displaying it okay
and U here after that I close this and I
say
unseen okay after this I'm breaking
it
here fine and uh copy the
same and uh pasting it
below you say like
[Music]
ex2 well ex1 is saying what display none
and style here we not be using V rather
we be saying visibility which option we
are using this visibility and this
visibility will be checking visibility
hidden in such case when I try to run
the
example you see like both the options
are not visible but when I say
inspect
you can see here it is saying display
none visibility hidden so you can see
here in this example both options are
not showing okay so the answer is very
clear to us none of the hyperlinks are
showing to us because that's where the
conditions
are okay so we understood about the way
how to basically hide the elements from
the browser
there is another feature friends coming
up uh in the CSS front and that is
called a feature called property called
important so important is again a type
of property it is a rule in CSS to add
more importance to a particular property
than like a normal value so important
will try to override all the previous
stylings and give the next available
value to your
element now let me show you how really
works so just imagine I have got
uh
this body tag and in this body tag we
have got
H1 we can say this
is heading
one okay like this I can
copy and
paste okay so this is heading one
heading one three times I'm playing it
now now this this case U I may have a
multiple classes are also available this
is a like normal I can
say equal
to I can
use head
one okay and here also I'm
saying rather than using
class okay I can use what
id equal to
head to you can change the name as you
want and here what I can do is in my
style I can use this first option for ID
that is
called head
two okay I can use one more that is
called Head one so two properties I have
it head one and head2 and we can also
use H1 as like a normal property head
two we can give this for ID I can say
background color I say pink head one I
can just use background
color or
red and here what I can do I can
overwrite the
properties so what I can do here in my
application I can say H1 here I say
background
okay color and here we can just use as a
what as a call Brown so if I say brown
in that case and if I make it as an
important like I say important by saying
XOM Mark important so what would happen
just take a look
here you will see it basically replacing
all the colors with what with brown
because I'm making it as a what as a
important and I said overrides or
overrule all the previous property if I
remove
it okay so it will be changing it to the
different color and here I just use What
DOT and here I use
what hash head to is the ID so I can
just use hash here and here we use What
DOT now you see they will be having
their own dedicated
colors okay I say like this but if I
just make it as a what important and I
use it as a call
what green yellow so you can see it will
apply the green yellow to
everywhere okay so that is an important
proper let's override all the previous
rules that's how the CSS
is okay everyone so our next example is
towards focus on JavaScript interview
questions now here we have few questions
are available like what are the various
data types in JavaScript so JavaScript
contains different type of JavaScript
data types like if you think
about all different types which are
there generally bite short int
long float double character Boolean
these are all different type of data
types are supported inside a
JavaScript okay now going ahead what is
the call back in Javas JavaScript so the
call back means is a
function okay that is passed to the
another function as an argument on an
parameter okay so what is the call back
call back means don't call me I will
call you clear so the idea is like you
are
passing the function itself is a
parameter to the another function
because the JavaScript is known to be
called non-blocking which never wait for
the code to finish it continues to move
on and due to some reason if your
function it's taking some time to you
know uh execute so JavaScript won't wait
for that particular function to finish
so you use call back to prevent such
Behavior okay that's called a JavaScript
call back now what is the difference
between function declaration and
function expression see this is called
function
declaration and you talk about a
function expression function declaration
is just to declare
a separate statement within a main
JavaScript code and you can be called
before the function is defined okay it
give you the better readability where
the function expression are always
created inside the
expression okay and it is created when
the execution Point reaches
it are we clear and it is used when
there is a need of for a conditional
Declaration of a particular
function now what do you understand
about the cookies in a JavaScript so it
is one of the very very common question
cookies are the one which is created by
the server stored in a client site which
is responsible to store all the
necessary client activities so that the
browser or the application give the
better recommendation to the
user okay so it is just a a small text
file which is stored in a browser itself
okay okay you want to record something
about a user activity you always put it
like that and you can also Define the
expiry time for the cookies okay as per
your convenience to decide how long the
cookie wants to be there inside your
browser if you do not offer any time
span by default the cie will get lost
immediately the moment the browser
closed next what are the closures in
JavaScript so closures are the
JavaScript is a feature where the inner
function has an access to Outer
functions variables and the
properties okay so you can consider a
closure has a three scope chain number
one it has an access to its own scope
that is defined within its cbris second
it has an access to the variable of the
outer function and also has an access to
the global
variables now the closure is a
JavaScript features as I told you like
which has has an access to the outer
functions variable simple example I can
give it to you is a function which is
known as called inner function and
there's a function defined on the top is
an outer function so it is having all
the functionalities exis of the outer
function inside
it now what are the Imports and export
in JavaScript so import and exports in a
JavaScript is a very very common way how
in Java you use the term name called
import a package but in JavaScript it is
little different unless you export
something you can't import it okay so if
you want to access any of your files
Properties or methods outside of your
file you always use the statement of
Import and Export so here you can see
you have a got one property like an sqrt
which you are exporting it and you have
one function which is called square
there's another function
called you can say diag which you're
exporting it and importing it just the
way you always want so that is how it is
importing and
exporting what is the difference between
undefined Undeclared and null in a
JavaScript see undefined means a
variable that is declared but the value
has not been assigned yet that is called
undefined Undeclared means like it is a
null first of all we talk about null
null means it is an assignment value
that we can assign to any variable that
is meant to contain no value and
Undeclared means the variables are not
declared and do not exist in a program
okay that is called what UND
declared how to remove the duplication
from the JavaScript array so you
basically needs to use the standard
filter methods okay this is basically
responsible to help you to analyze
whether we have some duplicates
available or not so we'll be using using
filter methods okay so these are
basically known as called array and the
current element and the index of current
element and by using the for Loop it is
an empty array is used for the storing
all the repeated
elements okay so these are known as
called a typical JavaScript discussion
which we have taken place multiple
questions are there which we have
already answered so here are the
Technologies
covered first up we'll look at questions
on node moving on we'll look at a few
questions on
PHP and then we'll go to database
management system like SQL and then
we'll look at Docker Jenkins Maven and
selenium so I hope these questions help
you and let's Dive Right
In hello this is Matthew and we're going
to be going through some of the simple
questions that you would be asked during
a node.js interview uh what we're going
to do is we're actually going to break
out this section into three key areas
there'll be beginner questions there
will be intermediate questions and
advanced Ed questions and the
expectation is as you go through this
video is that these questions could be
pushed together as you're going through
the interview kind of think of it like
this is if you've answer the beginner
questions that you would get asked at
the beginning of the interview with
confidence and shity uh then the client
is going to then jump to those
intermediate and Advan questions quite
quickly and they're looking for people
who can help them serve and solve their
problems at that more intermediate and
advanced level so let's just get started
so the first question you're probably
going to be asked is you know you know
what is node.js you know do you know
what it's for and essentially nodejs is
an one of the most popular if not the
most popular uh open- Source
crossplatform JavaScript programs um it
allows you to build out web applications
that run on the server it's extremely
flexible it allows you to implement a
lot of solutions outside of just the the
core programming runtime and allows you
to build Solutions extremely quickly in
an open-source mindset for
devops it is used essentially for
creating client siiz web
applications we'll see this later on and
you may want to talk a little bit about
using expressjs and how you can build
out apis uh to work with node.js and
connecting to databases such as
mongodb and that is also really good for
being able to store um a data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model um and this
is important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly so you're going to then ask be
asking you how does nodejs work well
node.js itself is actually built on the
V8 engine and the V8 JavaScript engine
is the same engine that runs JavaScript
in your Chrome web browser extremely
fast um it allows for um high output and
nonblocking through your IO input
outputs and is a single threaded event
Loop so you're going to be then ask you
know where can you use node.js and and
the reality is the applications for
node.js keep expanding um but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now uh so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications i' probably be
referencing the applications is a really
good starting point um because here you
can actually talk about maybe some
examples that you've done where you're
building out some of these web
applications uh indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and peppering your answers with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or uh training
examples that you've done the fact that
you've actually worked with nodejs and
created a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
nodejs with the practice of working with
node.js
so be asked about you know your
essentially the io refers to the
transfer of data in and out of uh a
system and that's really it you know
there's a reason why Google calls that
conference iio it's the trans transer
data in and out of our brains at that
conference the application is same here
it's about moving data in and out of
systems through using node.js and that
every um event can be tracked um whether
it's on a physical device or network or
files within the system again it's input
and
output so let's go through and you know
you're going to be asked you can you
explain the difference between front end
and backend development and this is a
question that I can ask a lot
when I'm meeting with clients um yeah
people get really confused about what is
the difference between front-end and
backend development um bottom line front
end is what gets resolved inside of your
web browser or the app on your uh mobile
device back end is what gets resolved um
essentially um what we call the know the
back office or server side applications
but that's becoming more and more
synonymous for what gets run in the
cloud so web application
um really get a lot of the functionality
of web application gets run in the front
end and I think with CSS HTML 5 uh
client side JavaScript it's all going to
get run in the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database um gets
run behind the scenes in the back end
and so you know um anything that's going
to have like Graphics is going to be on
the front end uh apis are going to be
run on the back end and then just
finally some of the scripting languages
that use on the front end uh so HTML CSS
JavaScript those are all Common Core
scripting um languages that you would
use you can use Frameworks such as
angularjs and reactjs or Vue uh those
would be front-end Frameworks uh backend
Frameworks would include Java PHP Python
and node.js are some of the backend
Technologies you could also throw in
there net as well Ian it's just a whole
you know Litany of front end and backend
Technologies Frameworks that you can use
um and this is a actually a good point
to kind of explain the experience you
have outside of just working with
node.js but other technologies that
you've been working with that
potentially that the client is also
using so another question you're going
to be asked when you're looking at
node.js is you know can you tell me
about npm and so when somebody asks you
what is npm the first thing you're going
to respond is do you mean node package
manager and the reason why you want to
respond like that is that you want to to
qualify their question with
understanding that you know what they're
talking about but you want them to
verify that and so no packet manager is
mpm and it's responsible for packaging
all of your modules that you're working
with in node.js and we have a whole
series of videos that we've done on node
GS and every single one of them uh
includes references to
mpm so you're going to be ask you know
so okay youve told me um what is you
know can you go into a a little bit more
um details you can provide two main
functionalities and so one of them is
being able to manage online repositories
of modules and packages um so you can go
to like search. nj.org and you can find
packages that you can install into your
uh solution uh such as
expressjs and it also provides a command
line utility that allows you to manage
uh your packages very quickly uh through
terminal window or command line
I use vs code a lot Visual Studio code
and it has a command line utility buildt
right into it that allows me to interact
with
mpm so what are some of the modules in
nodejs and so you know modules um in
nodejs they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you you can
think of some of the JavaScript
libraries that you may have used the
functionality is somewhat the same but
they're designed for node.js and to run
on the server
and there are ways in which you can go
ahead and create some of those modules
so for instance if we're creating a web
server you can actually use the require
commands to be able to require that the
server be there so the example we have
on the right hand side uh shows that we
really do need to have HTTP which is a
web server we require that to be
installed and uh so that if you're
running that uh mpm package it will
actually uh install the HTTP server and
then you can actually write some code to
actually then listen on the Local Host
Port 2,000 for where You' be running
your
application and there are just you know
there's a whole bunch of modules that
come with node.js right out of the gate
and here are some of the modules that
you have we also referenced just earlier
on hgp is a core module for running a a
web server uh you have a utility
function that is useful for developers
to um assess and features within your
node.js project you have a URL module
for any URL passing you'd be doing and
uh you also have a stream which allows
you to be able to stream data in and out
of your system and be able to manage how
that's being worked and then zib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep uh your
storage of files um to a minimum
so a question you're going to be asked
is you know why is nodejs being
preferred over backend Technologies such
as Java and PHP and particularly with
Java it's a very mature stable language
it's been around for more than 20 years
you know PHP um runs some of them the
most powerful and largest websites out
there such as Facebook so why would you
use node.js well the first response is
kind of a gima but it is really fast and
if you watched any of the videos that
we've done on node.js building out
Solutions and developing the solutions
you'll see just how fast it is um the
second is the really kind of the secret
source with node.js is the node package
manager and node package manager allows
you to install additional functionality
such as Express or as a database
into your solution really quickly and
there's over 50,000 bundles available
for node package
manager if you're building out a
realtime application that's data
intensive and you need to have apis
quickly developed then node.js is
another great is really the great
solution for you it allows you to build
out these Solutions really
quickly and there is a easy
synchronization between the server and
the client due to the code
base and then finally because the
structure of node.js is Javascript if
you are making the pivot from being a
front-end web developer to node.js it's
just going to make it a lot easier for
you to pick up node.js because you have
that common language of JavaScript and
on top of that JavaScript is the world's
most popular um scripting
language so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular and nodejs
and so the reason why this question may
come up is the person interviewing you
is seeing whether or not uh you do know
the difference between a frontend uh
framework and a backend framework and
this is one of those questions where you
can go well there are differences but
the differences are because they
complement each other um so angular is a
front-end development framework whereas
node.js is a server side framework other
differences though between the actual
Frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of JavaScript node.js is
written in C and
C++ angle is used for building out
single page uh client side web
applications and so that's a key word
there is client side whereas nodejs is
about building out fast and scalable
server side Network applications uh so
uh again the two complement each other
uh angulus splits web applications into
the MVC model view control components
whereas node.js generates a lot of
database queries it does more than that
as well but you can think of nodejs as
that glue to your
database so let's talk a little bit
about when you're connecting to a
database with node.js and so um you're
going to probably be ask you know what
is um the most popular database used
with node.js and there are are a couple
um mongod DB is largely the most popular
nosql crossplatform database MySQL is
also very popular and that's a more
traditional relational
database um you would go with mongod DB
for really more modern solutions when
you're looking at creating application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses um of data
that has to be uh created read updated
and deleted very very
quickly for some of the other popular
libraries that you use for node.js
expressjs is a very popular one um I
really like working with expressjs
allows me to build out web applications
really quickly um more importantly it
allows me to build out apis very quickly
and which you know apis are essentially
web applications themselves um but being
able to do that very quickly with a
framework like expressjs is very useful
U is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so um here is an example of
expressjs which is a in itself really a
flexible but a solution that you can do
lots with and which is a more
focused solution um which allows you
know to you make it easier to connect to
your
databases so you know what are the pros
and cons of working with no there's lots
of ways we explained this earlier on
that you can actually build out
applications that run on the cloud why
would you you know what's are the pros
and cons so a pro is that uh node.js is
extremely fast at processing thing an
event based model uh it really is fast a
con is if you have something that is a
very heavy computational task it's not
so good at that um now I will cave at
that this is that node.js is getting
better all the time and so uh you might
have to be provide an example of what a
very heavy computational task is and
that may be uh
calculating a risk on an insurance
application against many many variables
that may be something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can
offload uh the task to another solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth Pro uh
JavaScript is uh used for building out
your applications with uh no JS great
lots of people know J JavaScript a
restriction and again this is evolving
as JavaScript itself evolves is that uh
when you do a callback you may end up
doing lots of nested callbacks um if
you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that I always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier how do you get
around that barrier and so for instance
when you're talking uh to your
recruiter you can say look the reason
why I use node.js is that it's fast it's
event B driven I can use JavaScript uh
there are some challenges um but what I
do to get around those challenges are
and that's where you can say that you
know you may run the complex script off
and you may write that in net or Java or
pH HP and then use an API to do the
response back into node.js so you get
the benefits of Both Worlds but minimize
the investment in having to manage a
complex environment such as Java versus
a relatively simple environment with
nodejs uh the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality uh with over
50,000 packages there's a package for
that uh so from from being able to have
a a tool that creates unique identifiers
that you might need to have for
generating content that gets posted into
a database through to being able to
connect to databases through you know to
running so many different solutions uh
the mpm package manager with its access
to so many different packages makes it
great for um getting access to all that
content now a con is working with
relational databases with node.js isn't
as easy as a nosql database now you can
do it and there are ways around that and
what I would do when this question comes
up is always kind of pivot to say hey
this is how you can actually then uh get
around building out that
application Pro for nodejs designed for
streaming huge amounts of data in and
out a con is that node.js is single
threaded and so it can be CPU intensive
but again there are ways around that and
a good way around that is uh scaling
Your solution in elastic environment
such as the
cloud so what is the command used to
import an external library and so to
import an external Library the command
is the require command and so an example
we have here is you can start a variable
and the variable is going to be for HTTP
and you're going to then require the
HTTP Service uh that means that the
application itself won't run unless the
external Library the HTTP library is
installed okay so those were our
introductory questions for node.js let's
kind of pivot and take a look at the
intermediate questions that you would be
asked so what does event driven
programming mean so event driven
programming means that if something
happens something else will happen in
response so for instance if you click a
mouse that Mouse click is an event that
means something has to respond to that
event uh just think of it as cause and
effect it's just the basic motion of
physics so uh that's what event driven
programming means you also look at it as
a callback function uh so that when an
element is executed something will
happen in
response so what is an event Loop in
nodejs so an event Loop in node.js is
when you do an asynchronous call and
what that essentially means is that uh
you are sending out data and then
non-blocking input output uh from
node.js is pulling data back
in what is an event emitter in nodejs so
an event Met has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects uh
within your event and we have an example
of this on the right hand side and then
when ever an event actually is thrown uh
the functions are then called on that
event synchronously uh so for instance
we have in our example on the right hand
side we create an event and then we have
the functions and that executed in
series from that
event so let's talk about the API
functions in nodejs so there two types
uh one is an asynchronous non-blocking
function and the second is a synchronous
blocking function and the difference
between the two of them is asynchronous
is that there is no structure to the
order for how the uh API is resolved
synchronous means that when the feedback
from the API is received you have to
execute uh the response in a series for
how the response is sent to
you so what is a package Json file so
the package Json file is at the heart of
of our node.js uh package when we
actually will initialize a solution a
folder to be a node.js uh package you'll
find that the package itself holds all
of the metadata that's particular to the
project you're working on such as
project name version requirements it is
you have to have installed in the root
of the directory for the project and
again look at uh any of the videos that
we have on node.js we do have
demonstrations within those videos that
actually then go through and break out
um how to create that root package and
you'll see how you can actually then go
ahead and update the instructions or the
metadata within the package so here we
have an example of what that metadata
looks like so again this kind of
continues that question of what is a
package Json file and you may be asked
you know what is the metadata and why is
it important and the metadata is
a basic Json collection of pairing of uh
key details such as name version
description and then the custom version
that you put so for instance under name
you could create a name for your project
there can't be any spaces uh what is the
version and description and what is the
main or starting part uh for the
solution uh typically that would be
index.js but it could be anything. Js s
but index.js is typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web
application so how would you use a URL
module in
nodejs so with a URL module what allows
you to do is really two things one is
that it provides the resolution and
passing of a URL um for Utilities in
your application and then it allows you
to um extend your module with builtin uh
sus and split up the web address into a
readable
format so in this example um we have the
URL and the response it would would give
for that URL which would then be a year
and month um and it' be in a readable
format so it would read out as 2020 and
then the
month so what is expressjs now you've
heard we mentioned this a couple of
times in the video and we actually have
a separate video on expressjs um
expressjs is a web application framework
that allows you to build out Web
Solutions U for both mobile and
traditional desktop right inside of
nodejs it's very easy to use um being
able to install web.js is simple as
requiring Express to be installed in the
example that we have here on the screen
it's a full solution of showing how to
actually build out a solution with
web.js uh so in this example uh you
start off the first two lines uh require
Express to be installed and install
comes from node packet manager then we
have a simple application that will then
send to the browser window a hello world
message confirming that Express is up
and running and then the third block of
content starting with barus server
actually will Define the port Port where
your application's going to run so in
this instance uh the port is going to
run on Local Host and the uh Port will
be Port
8081 and so you can actually go to Local
Host colon 8081 and when you do that
that will trigger the application that
will forward up the message hello world
and it's all coming from
expressjs so what are streams in nodejs
so streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and
transform the readable on streams from
which data can be read uh the writable
streams that you can actually write to a
duplex is a stream where is both
readable and writable
and transform our streams that can be
manipulate the data while it is being
read or
written so how do you update and delete
a dependency so say for instance we want
to install uh something like Express so
if you wanted to install Express what
you would do is you would just write
them inside of your project um you want
to go to terminal window and write in
the command mpm install Express
if you want to update the dependencies
within your node package manager to
update all of them all you have to do is
write the command npm update all
dependencies and then if you want to
explicitly uninstall a dependency such
as expressjs uh that's using the
uninstall command and so that would
again be going to terminal window and
you would type mpm uninstall
Express and again it's really easy to
create a simple server in node.js that
will run a simple command the HTTP
service is actually built into node.js
uh you don't need to use expressjs I I
typically use expressjs when I want to
do a web server because typically what I
find is that I will want to go and do
something more complicated but if you
want to do something that illustrates
just the core functionality uh within
node.js you can actually just uh require
the core HTTP service that actually
comes as part of node.js and then you
can actually then go ahead and uh tell
it to create a service and then to write
in plain text a command um or text
string such as in this case it'll be
hello world and that would pop out and
then the final line is to then uh listen
that if you go to a web browser that's
on port1 127.0.0.1
colon uh 8080 once you actually go to
that that will trigger this application
and you'll get the text hello world pop
up on your screen so explain synchronous
and non-blocking apis in node.js
so all the apis in nodejs are
asynchronous which means they are
nonblocking which means you can run them
continuously um and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why nodejs scale so fast and the
a means that the apis can return data
send data after it's been called and
really increase the efficiency of events
they are triggered within node.js
so how do you implement async and
node.js and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example uh it's actually something that
can be done very quickly this example
we're actually uh making a command to
logo host and an app that's running on
Port 3000 and then depending on what we
get if there's an error message uh then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if uh we get a response to an
application uh then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response uh so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function uh to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous
code so what is the purpose of module
exports so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package in a single
file and then you can then share that
with other developers so you're all
working from the same
environment so what is a callback
function function in node.js a a
callback function is essentially that
once you run and you've triggered event
and the response has been given uh you
want to be able to then have a call back
to validate that the task is complete
all right let's move on to the final set
of questions which is Advanced node.js
questions so what is reppel in node.js
so repple stands for read eval print and
loop and this is a reference to the Unix
and Linux background that nodejs
has so reel will perform the following
tasks the read will be actually passing
the JavaScript you'll read that and
store it in memory eval takes and
evaluates the data structure print will
then print the results often on a
console window or onto a web page and
then Loop um Loops the above command
until the user presses contrl C
twice what is the control flow function
so the control flow function is a piece
of code that runs between several of the
asynchronous functions and that's it it
actually controls how those functions
execute so how control flow controls the
function calls and it does it through
four ways one is it controls the order
of execution uh it collects the data it
limits the concurrency and then it also
calls the next step in a program again
this is a management tool for how your
functions are called within node.js
so what is the difference between fork
and spawn methods in node.js
so the essential difference between the
two of them is that if you use the fork
method it will actually trigger and
create a new instance of the V8 engine
the engine running node.js and will then
run the application in that new instance
with
spawn it's somewhat similar it doesn't
actually generate a new V8 instance so
it's actually creating a new process but
it's within the same V8 instance as the
previous application that it was Spawn
from explain to me what is the use of
buffer class in node J so with the B
Class what you're looking at doing is
you're actually controlling the raw data
of a set of arrays and integers and the
memory allocation outside of the V8 Heap
buff class is used because pure
JavaScript is not compatible with binary
data what is piping in node.js
so piping is the ability to connect the
output of one stream to another stream
that could be data stream it could be
any stream that you're working with um
but it does normally get used to pass
data from one stream to
another so what are some of the flags
used in the rewrite operation files uh
so R Dash is used for read W is for
opening a file for writing uh a dash is
opening a file for a pending um so the
collection that you have here you don't
have to really memorize all of them but
to have a few of them in the back of
your mind is always a good U reference
point so how would you open a file using
nodejs so the syntax you would use would
be the fs. open and that would then open
up a
file explain to me what callback hell is
uh so callback hell also known as the
Pyramid of Doom is when you have too
many nested unreadable and unmanageable
call bags intensively cycle within each
other and they're constantly reading to
each other and they're not able to
resolve the
solution and uh this is a you know it's
a big problem and this is what why it's
called cback H because you're not able
to finalize the the app you're working
up what is a reative pattern in
nodejs and so a reactor pattern is a
concept of non-blocking IO operation
ations can you explain to me the test
pyramid for node.js so the test pyramid
and this is standard for testing uh for
all devops is really split into three
key areas you have unit tests
integration tests and then end to end or
E toe tests uh the unit tests are tests
that you're actually doing your raw code
uh that you're working on and the goal
there is to be able to validate that the
code your writing is consistently
working uh integration allows ows you to
um have tests that integrate your raw
code that you're working within your
application with other areas of an
application and then end to end is the
whole system the whole interface as it
were uh for your
solution describe the exit codes of
node.js
so an exit code is a specific code that
uh identifies the end of a specific
process and examples of uh EX codes are
unused uncal fatal exception uh fatal
error uh internal JavaScript evaluation
area these are all good examples of exit
codes so what is um middleware can you
explain the concept of middleware in
nodejs uh so with middleware it is the
ability to be able to connect to a
system and get data from it um that's
outside made of node.js so this may be
executing a type of code or updating a
modifying request in response to a
specific type of object uh finishing the
request response
cycle can you explain to me what are the
types of HTTP requests that you may use
when working with node.js um there are
actually quite a lot um but four of them
that you might use would be get post
head and delete
and these are if you've done any uh web
application before particular if you
worked with forms inside of a web
application you're probably very
familiar suddenly with get and post uh
get is the request to retrieve data post
is generally used for changing STA and
data uh head is similar to get um but
also asks for response if there's no
body content so if you're using if
you're developing an API this would be a
good one to use and delete is used to
delete the predetermined uh
source so how would you connect to
mongod DB database and with node.js and
you use that using the client and
the example we have on the left hand
side illustrates
that what is the use of
nodecore EMV and so the nodecore EMV is
an environmental variable that stands
for node environment in Express server
so the example we have on the right hand
side allows you to illustrate how you
would do that for say a production
environment so what are some of the
various timing features in node.js so
the timing functions that you can use
here set timeout and then clear timeout
and you to schedule code execution that
you'd have inside of your
application you also have set interval
and clear interval to execute a block of
code up multiple times in your
application uh set intermediate and
clear intermediate to uh execute code
and that is at the end of your
application we'll discuss some of the
frequently asked questions in PHP
interviews now the questions are
categorized in two sections beginner and
advanced questions so without any
further Ado let us get started with the
beginner questions now the most basic
question is what is PHP so PHP stands
for hypex pre-processor it is a serers
side scripting language that is embedded
into HTML and is generally used for
dynamic web development phps also a very
compatible language that is it also
works efficiently with almost 20
different databases such as MySQL post
reql Etc next question what is a session
in PHP now sessions in PHP are used to
store data for users under under a
unique ID which can be then used across
multiple web pages of a website next
what is Pier in PHP now Pier stands for
PHP extension and application repository
it is a framework and repository for the
reusable components focus on reusable
components of PHP containing code
Snippets and libraries next is PHP
considered a case sensitive language so
this is a very often asked questions in
interviews so PHP is partially case
sensitive since variables in PHP are Cas
sensitive while functions and user
defined functions are not next name
different types of data types in PHP so
different data types in PHP include
integer float string Boolean array
object null and finally resource so
there are total eight different data
types that exist in PHP next question
how is Echo different from print now
Echo it can output multiple strings at a
time while in case of print it can
output only a single string now Echo
does not have a return value while print
always returns one that is the reason
that is Echo is faster because it does
not have to return a value while it is
print is slower in comparison to Echo
because it always returns a value now as
you can see both of these commands Echo
and print are used in the exact same way
next what are the rules for naming a
variable now there are certain rules
which you have to follow or certain good
coding practices which you have to
follow while while naming a variable in
your PHP code so variable name must
always begin with underscore or a letter
so it cannot begin with a number or a
special character for that matter next
variable names can include numbers but
not special characters so suppose you
want to name your variable number 1 2 3
so you can use this variable but you
cannot use number at theate 1 to3 since
special C C are not included next a
variable in PHP is declared using this
dollar sign followed by the variable
name now as you can see this is how we
declare a variable dollar myor variable
you can also put a number in between or
at the end while naming a variable just
not at the start next name some popular
PHP Frameworks so some of the popular
PHP Frameworks include Symphony code
igniter K PHP and larell moving on how
to check if a defined variable is null
or not so is a than function is used to
check if the defined variable has any
value or not so to use this suppose you
have this block of code in front of you
so suppose you want to check if this x
variable that you've defined is null or
not so what you do is you put the is it
function inside the if condition and it
will return true if it's not null while
it will return false if it is a null
value since it is not null it returns
true and we can display Echo as variable
X is not null while in the case of
variable y it is a null value since so
the if condition will be false and it
will not display anything next how are
objects in PHP passed so objects in PHP
are always passed by value not by
reference next question how to display
output directly to the browser now in
cases you want to display your output
directly onto the browser while running
a piece of code you can use it use these
special tags to display an output
directly to the browser now as you may
notice these tags does not contain the
PHP written you can use them directly
and replace PHP with an equal to sign
followed by what you want to display and
end it with a question mark and a
closing bracket moving on what is
defined function used for in PHP now
Define is used to declare a constant in
PHP also in contrast to the variables
there's no need for a dollar sign before
declaring a constant since the value of
a constant does not change and this is
how you can use the defined function to
declare a constant suppose we want to
declare the value of pi as 3.14
throughout your PHP code and which
cannot be changed so we can use Define
for that next question is is related to
this question since what is constant
function in use for in PHP then so
constant function Returns the value of a
constant it is not used to define a
constant but it Returns the value of a
constant so suppose you define a
function constant using this defined
function and you want to return this
value you can use this constant function
for that next is multiple inheritance
support Ed in PHP so PHP only supports
single level inheritance which means a
class can be extended from only one
class using the keyword extended next
what are the different types of Loops in
PHP so PHP consists of a v Loop a dowi
loop a for Loop and finally a for each
Loop so PHP consists of total four Loops
next question how to concatenate two
strings in PHP now two strings can be
easily concatenated using the dot
operator in PHP now to do that I'll show
you with the help of a code suppose you
want to concatenate or join these two
strings Str str1 hello guys and the
second string would be and welcome to
Simply learn and want to display these
strings together so to do that you need
to use this dot operator in Echo as you
can see this dot operator so first you
write the name of the first string Then
followed by the dot operator I've given
this space and then the next dot
operator because this is also considered
as a string and then the third string
variable and this is how you concatenate
two strings next question what is the
use of function num arguments now this
function as you can see is used to
return the number of arguments passed in
a function so suppose you pass a certain
number of arguments in a function and
want to know how many values or
arguments were passed you can use this
function for that so suppose in this
sample code you want to know how many
arguments were passed in this sample
function so to do that we declare a
variable number of arguments and we will
equal it to the function of number
function number arguments now we will
display it and this sample has passed
three arguments so the output would be
three moving on what are super Global
variables in PHP now some predefined
variables in PHP are known as super
Global variables because they are always
accessible from any function file or
class regardless of the scope so in all
in all they are globally accessible so
suppose you write a piece of code and
you declare a variable inside it it
would be a local variable and could be
accessed only in that part of the code
but in case of super Global variable
they are accessible throughout the
entire code they include Global server
request post get files EnV cookie and
session moving on how to invoke single
line and multi-line comments now a
single line comment in PHP can be made
using this hash followed by the comment
or double slash followed by the comment
while in case of multi-line comments you
can use this hash star and write your
comments in multiple lines and enclose
it with a star and slash what I'm going
to do now is I am going to show you the
use of these comments in actual VSS code
now let us take this block of code for
example now suppose you want to add a
com single line comment after this
variable so what you will do is you can
use this double slash this
is a
variable also you can use
slash this is also a variable variable
so this is a single L line comment now
if you try to write something else after
this in the next line it will take it as
part of the code not part of the comment
so what do you do when you need to write
multiple lines of comment so suppose you
need to write two three lines about this
line of code what you'll do is you'll
use a slash star now write the comment
this is
displaying simply learn so this is a
three line comment which you can end
simply by star and a slash this is how
you write single line and multi-line
comments now let's move on to the next
question that is name some common
applications of PHP so some of the most
commonly used PHP applications are
system functions form handling so PHP is
very commonly used to handle the forms
that you see on the web pages crud task
now crud task are create read update and
delete so when you will be working with
databases this is a very important part
of using databases that is crud and PHP
is used very commonly in that next
accessing cookies variables and set
cookies and finally data encryption PHP
provides security through some of its
Frameworks which can be used and is used
very commonly throughout a lot of
websites so now that we have gone
through the beginner level questions
that are frequently Asked in PHP
interviews let us now move on to the
advanced level questions so the first
question would be how can you execute a
PHP script from the command line now a
pH PHP script from a command line can be
executed by by opening the command line
and inside the command line you have to
specify the name of the script or name
of the PHP file that you want to run
suppose you want to run a PHP script.php
so you type in the name of the PHP
script that you want to run and that
particular PHP script will be executed
next differentiate between a dollar
variable and double dollar variable so
what is the difference between the two
now in case of a single dollar variable
is it is a simple variable that is
simply used to store data so as we
discussed earlier it is a variable that
we Define to store different data types
that as integer float strings Etc while
a double dollar variable is a reference
variable of variable so this is used to
reference already existing variables now
to use or to understand how these two
work you can see this particular block
of code here now in this code what you
need to focus on is this is a simple
variable hello which contains the string
welcome to Simply learn and we have
Define another variable as well which
contains the string hello now in this
Echo as you can notice what we are doing
is we are using this also before that
you need to notice is this is the same
string as the name of this variable so
first we are displaying this variable
and then we are referencing this
variable here so what it is doing is it
is referencing the value to another
variable so hello variable is being
referen so when you execute this block
of PHP script what you get the output is
hello since this is the variable hello
and after that what you'll get is
welcome to Simply learn since this
variable is a reference to this variable
next differentiate between get and post
method now get method is used to submit
form dat dat while post method is also
used for the same feature so the
difference between them is get method
sends data as part of PHP page URL sorry
web page URL while a post method sends
data through HTTP header in get the data
since the data is been sent through the
URL it is displayed in the URL of the
web page so it is not secure while in
case of post method it is a secure form
of data transfer hence When developing a
website for some security purposes
usually we prefer post method next up
how to connect to a database using a PHP
script now suppose if you are asked this
question in an interview what you need
to do is you need to just write this
block of code and explain it to the
interview now suppose we have a PHP
script and we want to connect it to a
database what we need to do is we will
create three different variables that is
server name username and password now
what we're going to do is we will create
another variable con that will be used
to connect it and then we'll use the
mysqli I functions which will then pass
these variables to create a connection
so these variable values are Local Host
username and password these are the
default values now to check if the
connection is connected what we're going
to do is we will use an if condition if
the con variable gets an connect error
we will display a error message that is
connection failed if not we will display
connected successfully now as you can
see here these names can be the name of
the server that you're trying to connect
I have used Local Host username password
for the default values you can use the
name of the database that you're trying
to connect your PHP script to next up
what does final class and final method
mean in PHP now a final class in PHP
means that the class cannot be extended
while a final method means that it
cannot be overridden now as you can see
in the this block of code we have used
the final keyword for a class and the
final keyword for a function now suppose
you this final class is being inherited
by this child class what the program
will return is an error because once you
use this final keyword this class cannot
be inherited and similarly suppose this
function is trying to be overridden by
this part of the code it cannot be
because we have used the final function
next question differentiate between
function overloading and overriding Now
function overloading the same function
is used for different purposes based on
the number of arguments inside the
function while in case of function
overriding the same name and same
argument function is used in parent and
child class respectively to change the
behavior of parent class method now let
me show you and demonstrate the
difference with an example so let us
look at this code so suppose you have a
function named show title which does
have contain a single parameter and
displays when called upon using this
parameter displays function one now if
you want to use the same
name of the function for a different
purpose what you can do is you can
increase or change the number of
parameters inside the function that is
it now contains two parameters so when
this same function is called using two
parameters it will function differently
and display function overloading so this
is how function overloading works next
from this piece of code we can
understand function overriding suppose
you display a function demo in a base
class and you want to override this demo
function inside the derived class so
what you do is you make another function
with the same name inside the derived
class with some different properties as
you can see it displays something
different now you create an object for
the base class and when you use this
Base Class object to call this demo
function you can use the property of
this function here while if you create
another object that is object two for
the derived class and you use this
object to call upon the same demo
function you are overriding this Base
Class demo function that was inherited
instead what it will use is it will use
the properties of the derived demo
function so that is how you overload or
override a class function in p HP now
let's move on to the next question that
is differentiate between equal to equal
to and triple equal operator so a double
equal operator is generally used to
check if the value of two operant are
equal or not it is generally used in
case of conditional statements while a
triple equals to operator performs a
type save comparison which means that
will that it will only return true if
both operant have the same type and the
same value so you can understand this
more with this piece of code so suppose
in this case since they both are equal
it will return true while in this case
they both have the same type hence it
will return true now let us NE check
this equals to equals to since they both
are one and in PHP it will display as
true since they are equal while when you
are type checking that is you are
checking if they equal with the same
type and same value it will display a
false since one is an integer and the
other one is a string value also if you
check two different strings with the
type save it will also display true next
question how does exception handling
work in PHP so when an exception is
thrown code following the statement will
not be executed and PHP will attempt to
find the first matching catch block so
if an exception is not caught a PHP
fatal error will be issued with an
uncaught exception an exception can be
thrown and caught within PHP so what we
do is we use this try and catch method
to try the code and if an error occurs
we can catch
if an exception occurs we can throw it
and the catch function will catch the
exception and if there we do not include
the catch function it will result in a
fatal error next up differentiate
between require and include now require
if a required file is not found it will
throw a fatal error and stop the code
execution while in case of include if an
essential file is not found it will
produce a warning and still execute the
remaining scripts so as you can see both
of these include and require I use in
the exact same way with different
functions next up explain different
types of errors in PHP now PHP consists
of mainly three errors notice warning
and a fatal error now notice is a
non-critical error which means that
something minor went wrong during execu
ution and a lot of times you just don't
pay attention to it a warning is a
critical error now it is given in
condition where suppose an include
function that we just discussed in the
previous question then to retrieve a
non-existent file so suppose you use an
include function and the file does not
exist it will display a warning and
final is a fatal error so it is a
critical error resulting in termination
of the code so as we discussed in the
try and catch part of the question if an
exception is thrown and we do not have a
catch function for it it will display a
fatal error which will return in
termination of the code next question
how to call a function by reference so
erson sign is used to call a function by
reference now in case of reference the
actual value is modified if the value
pass inside the function if is also
modified while in case of value the
value of the original value does not
change so this piece of code here is an
example of how you can call a function
by reference here as you can see this
erson sign will call this function by
reference and any changes made in the
variables here will affect the original
ones next question create a Singleton
class in PHP so how do we create a
Singleton class in PHP before that let's
have a look at what is a Singleton class
now a singl turn class in PHP is a class
that can have only one object and hence
provides only a single point of access
so in generally generally in class you
can create as many objects as you want
and it will in turn create different
access points into that block of code so
in a Singleton class you can only create
a single object hence single T So this
piece of code as you can notice is used
to create a Singleton class now in to
create a Singleton class you need to
have the Constructor function private
now here as you can see a Singleton
class is created using this private
construct and it then checks if there's
only one instance created and if it it
is it functions properly and displays
initialize only once next question how
to encrypt a password using PHP so PHP
can be used for encryption techniques
now the password unor hash function
creates a hash password from the
password string using hashing algorithm
so suppose you create a password string
and enter your password as password at 1
123 and you put put it inside the
password has hash function so what it
will generate is we are echoing this
generated hash so what it will generate
is this so this is the This Is Random it
changes every time you generate the
password since it is encrypted and same
when you pass this password to the
database using hashing algorithm even in
the database the password will not be
visible so your data is secure next
question mention different sorting
functions for array in PHP now let us
understand this question in the vs code
so PHP consists of different sorting
functions which you can use to sort an
given array automatically so if you want
to sort an array in ascending order what
you need to do is use this sort function
so it will sort this array in ascending
order now now if you want to sort it in
descending order use R sort that is
reverse sort similarly suppose you want
to sort an array in terms of value in
ascending order so you need to use a
sort function that is this so in terms
of value what in terms of value means is
suppose in a given erray there are keys
and values so it will sort the array
based on the values that is this 22 27
and 37 so the arror will be the same
since the values are already sorted now
if you want to sort the array in
according to key that is this you can
use kort that is key sort function that
is provided in PHP so in case of key
sort what it does is it will sort the
array in key that is the first one would
be D that is Duke second M Mac and the
third r that is RW now if you want to
sort this array in descending order in
terms of value you use instead of a sort
you use a reverse sort similarly if you
want to sort an array in terms of key in
descending you use K instead of K sort k
r sort that is K reverse sort so these
are the different sorting functions that
are in built into PHP moving on what
will be the output of the following code
now if this code is given let me give
you some time and try to pause this
video and think of what will be the
output of the following code so the
output of this code will be 21 comma 21
or 21A 21 how did it happen but before
that if if you got it correct
congratulations but if you want to
understand it see a is a variable that
contains the value one while a b is a
variable that is getting the value of a
variable through reference now we make
changes in the B variable with two
followed by this variable again which is
calling the value of a by reference so
if we make changes here we also make
changes in the value of a now if we
display this since the value of a is
already changed by reference it will
display 21 that is the value here and
again since the value of B is already 21
it will again display 21 moving on what
are construct function and distruct
function in PHP so a Constructor or
construct function is automatically
invoked when a new object of a class is
created and then can be used to
initialize value in class so when you
you create a object an object for a
class A Constructor function is
automatically
invoked but this can also be so it does
not contain any value when it is invoked
but you can also use this construct
function to initialize some properties
to give some properties to the class
which will act as its default properties
if nothing or no new properties are
given to the class next next is a
destruct now a destruct is automatically
invoked when an object of a class is
destructed suppose you end the part of
the code of a class you want you are
destroying the object when you're ending
the piece of code a destruct function is
automatically invoked to clean up the
resources next is how can PHP and
JavaScript interact now PHP and
JavaScript cannot directly interact with
each other since since PHP is a server
side scripting language while JavaScript
is a client side language but there is a
way that these two wonderful languages
can interact with each other so we can
swap variables since PHP can produce
JavaScript code to be implemented by the
browser so yes you can produce
JavaScript code from PHP which can then
be implemented by a browser and then it
is probable to pass those precise
variables back to PHP via a URL next
question is explain type hinting in PHP
now in PHP type hinting is used to
specify the expected data type that is
array object interface etc for an
argument in a function declaration now
during a function call suppose if
arguments does not match the expected
data type the runtime will display an
error and the pro that is a fatal error
and the program will then terminate now
in this code here what we are doing is
we are type hinting so this is this code
is for string type hinting and this code
is for integer type hinting now if these
particular set of functions that have
already specified the type they're
expecting does not receive the same type
of variable inside them the program will
return in a fatal error and it will
terminate so moving on to our final
question of this video write a class so
yes this is a an assignment a kind of
assignment for you guys so what you need
to do is you need to write a class to
solve the following question which I'm
going to say so Implement a class named
basketball we all like basketball right
so Implement a class named basketball
with an attribute named baskets so you
have you have to create an attribute
name baskets and initialize it to zero
as the starting position and then create
a method named score now when the score
method is invoked the baskets must
increase by one so let's see the
solution now so this is how you create a
class that is
basketball now inside this class what we
are going to do is we are going to
initialize the number of baskets that is
this this variable as zero as the
starting position so to do that what
we're going to do is we will be using
construct function as we discussed to
initialize some default properties for
the class so this construct function is
used to initialize this basket's
variable to zero now suppose we do not
call this function score which is
increasing the number of baskets the
default value will be displayed as zero
every time now suppose we invoke this
core function every time a basket is CED
this will increase the number of baskets
by one so this is pretty simple and this
is how you create a simple class which
will perform the following question SQL
is a very important technology that is
used in the IT industry so if you also
want to become a successful software
developer and gain handsome salary
packages then look at the wide range of
software development courses by simply
learn in collaboration with the top
universities across the globe by
enrolling in any of these certification
programs you will Master modern coding
techniques with boot camp level
intensity becoming a fulltech
technologist these program lays the
foundation for crafting full stack web
applications so what are you waiting for
hurry up and enroll now a year of
experience is preferred to enroll in
these courses so check out the link
mentioned in the description box below
for more details
in this session we are going to
understand who a full stack developer is
what are his desired skills the amount
of money he makes on an average per year
and finally I'll help you build a resume
for your future
endeavors first let's understand who a
full stack developer is everybody uses
social media applications the main
reason we use them is that they provide
excellent user experience and
interface these apps work pretty
seamlessly all thanks to fullstack
developers a fullstack developer is
associated with creation of a product
from its start to finish he designs the
front end and the back end of an
application while ensuring its
efficiency reliability and other crucial
features now that you have a basic
knowledge of what a fullstack developer
does let's look at some of the desirable
skills of a fullstack developer first up
for the front end development you should
have a good understanding of HTML and
CSS HTML short of hyper text markup
language governs the appearance of text
and images on the screen it formats the
text as headings paragraphs or
popups CSS on the other hand is a
styling sheet it helps with beautifying
the content on your screen in the form
of font size colors and
spacing next crucial necessity is
Javascript it is a powerful client side
programming language mainly used for
enhan ening user interaction with the
application it offers several libraries
and Frameworks like react angular View
and jQuery you need to be proficient in
one or more of these
tools next up we have Version Control a
Version Control basically records all
the changes made to file over time so
that you can recall them at any point in
time most predominantly used our git and
GitHub git is a free and open-source
distributed Version Control System
system designed to handle everything
from small to very large projects with
speed and
efficiency on the other hand GitHub is a
repository that provides a user
interface for Git it provides features
like Fork pull and merge moving on to
backin skills basic knowledge of node is
essential node is the hottest JavaScript
runtime environment around right now
used by a ton of applications and
libraries if you're writing applications
for the server nodejs you need to be
familiar with the
environment next up is
python python is used for several
reasons when it comes to full stack
developers the most common one being the
fact that it is better readable than
other languages like C C++ or Java it is
easy to learn and does not require a lot
of coding it also comes with many
libraries and Frameworks and has a
thriving Community for
developers Jango is a highlevel python
framework work that performs actions
like authentication database migration
and URL routing among others finally the
backend skills would require having good
knowledge of dbms some of the commonly
used databases are Cassandra mongodb and
Oracle database you should be able to
update the databases and retrieve
information as and when
needed a fullstack developer needs to
process some basic soft skills as well
first up is creativity the developer
must understand the objectives of of the
project and should create a product that
engages the target audience next up we
have strategic planning planning is a
critical phe in any development life
cycle the developer should process the
aptitude to strategically plan the
design development and implementation
faces this helps streamline the
process next up we have analytical
skills as the name suggests it's crucial
to analyze the information and make
decisions so as to maximize efficiency
now these are skills that one develops
when they're exposed to but a good sense
of understanding is
required problem solving skills are
again crucial to predict any errors and
develop a bug-free
application from the business
perspective as well problem solving
skills play a significant role in
ensuring the smooth conduction of
tasks and finally we have time
management skills the developer must be
able to meet the deadlines while
ensuring proper execution of his
tasks moving on let's look at the full
stack developer
salary in India the average salary of a
full stack developer is about 590,000
rupees per Amon in the US the average
salary of a fullstack developer is
around 75,000
us now if you wish to make a career as a
fullstack developer or wish to look out
for better opportunities a good resum is
key first let's look at a sample resume
