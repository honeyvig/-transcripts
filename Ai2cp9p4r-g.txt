2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,480
so just before we begin the actual video

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,560
today I'd just like to say that an early

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,680
access copy of my book hello Swift IOS

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,359
app programming for kids and other

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,119
beginners has been released you can find

7
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,560
it on many bookstores online such as

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,439
Amazon chapters and Indigo as well as

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,000
the Publishers website I really do hope

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,920
it helps you along your journey of

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,600
learning the Swift programming language

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,559
for iOS development all right so let's

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,640
get into the tutorial now so hello there

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,160
and welcome to another tutorial my name

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,280
is Tammy bakshi and this time we're

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,559
going to be going over how you can code

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,359
and use Bridges between different

18
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,120
programming languages all right so to

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,800
begin today I'd like to say a big thank

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,000
you to retesh for sending in this

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,760
question on Twitter uh and so basically

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,680
what we're going to be doing today is we

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,840
are going to be using the following

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,560
programming language programming

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,479
language combinations and I'm going to

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,200
be telling you how to create Bridges

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,240
between Java and Ruby Swift and python

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,600
as well as Swift PHP and

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,400
MySQL all right so let's begin with the

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,000
very first topic of this video today

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
which is how you can create Bridges

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,400
between Java and Ruby all right so now

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,680
the main way that you should be doing

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,640
this or at least the main way that I

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,600
believe uh is quite simple to actually

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,640
do uh is using shell let me explain uh

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,119
so let's say we've got two little bricks

38
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,719
here okay these bricks are respectively

39
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,320
Java and of course we've

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,960
got we too big of a box there but we've

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,840
also got

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,479
Ruby has another programming language so

43
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,119
we've got jav and

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,799
Ruby now let's say you've got a very

45
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,440
very simple Ruby script uh that takes

46
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,959
two numbers all right uh two and three

47
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,080
for example and we'll add them together

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,959
and print the screen five and that's in

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,440
Ruby and let's just say that you'd like

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,720
to call that code from java what would

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,239
you do well first of all let's take a

52
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,680
look how you regularly run this Ruby

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,760
script now what you would usually do is

54
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,280
you would go to your terminal

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,920
and this signifies your terminal this

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,160
dollar sign and you would type in

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,120
Ruby script

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
script.

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,040
RB and then you give it your parameters

60
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,800
like 2

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,879
three okay and what's going to happen is

62
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,080
it'll run the Ruby command on script. RB

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,239
and it'll give it the two and three

64
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,959
arguments and then those arguments can

65
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,080
then be used to add and then it'll give

66
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,440
you the result five and then you have

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,440
your terminal again now this is

68
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,560
something called a shell command and

69
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,560
well now we've actually determined that

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Ruby is basically just sitting on top of

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,159
this shell

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,680
platform okay we're basically running

73
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,440
Ruby off of shell in this case now the

74
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,400
thing is the exact same logic applies to

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,799
Java we're calling Java off of

76
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,400
shell more specifically we're running

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,360
the Java Das jar function and we're

78
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,000
running our jar our Java

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,080
jar now let's just ignore how we

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,519
actually call Ruby FAL okay but we're

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,879
basically what what my what the idea is

82
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,040
in order to get uh these two programming

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,599
languages Bridge together is the fact

84
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,319
that both of these are not only based

85
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,680
off of shell but can then in turn call

86
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,239
Shell

87
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,239
commands as most most programming

88
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,560
languages can so Java can call Shell

89
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,079
commands and can get output from them

90
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,040
and so can

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,239
Ruby

92
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
shell okay and since these both are

93
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
based off of shell and can run shell

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,680
commands it becomes so so e easy to

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,960
bridge them the reason is because all we

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,479
need to do is let's just say we want to

97
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,000
call that Ruby script from java what we

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,919
do is since Ruby's based off of shell

99
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,039
and we can call Shell from java all we

100
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,280
need to do is tell Java to call Shell

101
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,479
Shell then calls that Ruby shell

102
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,320
script

103
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,680
okay and once shell once this shell has

104
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,639
called our Ruby script and once Ruby has

105
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,600
given those instructions back to

106
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,759
Shell this shell is able to give output

107
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,160
to

108
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,080
Java the shell Handler

109
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,960
more

110
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
specifically and then what happens is

111
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,240
we're able to get our output into

112
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,800
Java then once Java has the output it's

113
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,199
free to do whatever it actually wants to

114
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,880
with that output and this is actually

115
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,280
quite a simple way of having a

116
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,639
programming language bridge and it works

117
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,520
the exact same way if you like to

118
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,120
contact from Ruby to Shell in fact now

119
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,600
let's cut over to the Mac part where I'm

120
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,319
going to show you how you can actually

121
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,600
implement this so let's cut over to a

122
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,160
short code part and then we'll be back

123
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,919
to the Whiteboard part to discuss how

124
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,840
you can Bridge Swift and python all

125
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,000
right so now I'm going to be showing you

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,440
how you can implement the bridge between

127
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,800
Java and Ruby all right so let's take a

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,240
look so to begin let me show you the

129
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,600
extremely simple Ruby script that we're

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
going to be using today now first of all

131
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,360
just before I actually get to the Ruby

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,960
script though I like to show you I have

133
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,160
this little Java project ready called

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,600
Call Ruby code and this Java project uh

135
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,160
is actually quite simple and what I've

136
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,240
done is I've actually gone into a

137
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,759
terminal window and cded into this

138
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,720
directory if you seen the list here uh

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,680
we've got of course as you know by

140
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,800
default the bin and Source directories

141
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,720
uh but we've also got this script called

142
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,039
add to numbers. RB if I open it up as

143
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,400
you can see it's a very very simple Ruby

144
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,599
script inside of the Java projects

145
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,960
directory uh and basically all we do

146
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,680
here is we print to the screen or put to

147
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,759
the screen uh the first argument that it

148
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,039
was given to an integer plus the second

149
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,560
argument that was given to an integer

150
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,520
now basically what this means uh is

151
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,039
we're taking both of the arguments that

152
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,440
was given via the command line and we

153
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,960
are converting them to integers adding

154
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,560
them together and putting them back onto

155
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,520
the

156
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,919
screen once that's done you should have

157
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,800
a very simple Ruby script that can do

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,599
this so if you type in Ruby add to

159
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,680
numbers. rb23 it should give you five if

160
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,440
you were to write 50,000 maybe 25,000 it

161
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
should give you 7500 uh 75,000 sorry uh

162
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,319
so you can just you know add in put any

163
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,720
two numbers here and it will add them up

164
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
uh except for decimals you have to put

165
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
in integers uh and it should be able to

166
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,120
add them up and give you your

167
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,720
output now basically let's just say you

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,599
wanted to call this code from java how

169
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,479
would you do that well it's actually

170
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,199
quite simple now the first thing you

171
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,000
need to do is make Java available to ACC

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,199
actually access the shell environment

173
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,759
and the way we can do that is by

174
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,720
implementing my very own little run

175
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,520
shell function and the Run shell

176
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,039
function returns a string but it also

177
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,879
takes a string called command and this

178
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,520
is the actual shell command that you'd

179
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,639
like to run and this function can throw

180
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,440
an

181
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,759
exception now inside here as you can see

182
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,599
I'm defining the output variable and

183
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,560
this is basically a string that contains

184
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
the final output for the

185
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,199
user or technically what came from our

186
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,120
shell command

187
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
once that's done I'm creating a new

188
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,919
process called execution process and

189
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,319
we're setting this execution process to

190
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,440
a new runtime execution process and

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,080
we're giving it the command that you

192
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,800
gave for that shell command then what

193
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,479
we're doing is we're telling it to wait

194
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,599
for this process to be done because what

195
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,080
we've just gone ahead and done is we've

196
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,560
given that uh I guess you could say

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,960
execution Handler uh to a different

198
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
process but what we're doing is we're

199
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,759
telling this process to wait for itself

200
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,720
to be done and then we'll continue with

201
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,200
the rest of the Java code and so once

202
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,839
that is done we take that execution

203
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,039
process and we get it input stream and

204
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,080
we put that into a new variable called

205
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,599
is we then create a new input stream

206
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,120
reader called is reader uh based off of

207
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
that input stream and then we create a

208
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,680
buffered reader called reader from that

209
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,240
input stream reader uh and this is a new

210
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,120
buffered reader instance then there's a

211
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,160
little bit of logic that we use in order

212
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
to extract all of the lines from our

213
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,519
buffered read reader into our output

214
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,399
variable now this is a little bit of I

215
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,440
guess you could say work around is logic

216
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,160
uh and it's not recommended for your

217
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,120
applications necessarily but it should

218
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,760
work in really every single circumstance

219
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,640
so I'm not exactly uh I mean it's not

220
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,680
bad basically uh but the way this works

221
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,760
uh is essentially we are using

222
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,839
exceptions to our advantage I guess you

223
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,720
could say uh so inside of our try catch

224
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,760
here uh I have inside of the tri block

225
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,880
uh an infinite Loop a while true Loop

226
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,160
which is infinitely going on it'll never

227
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,560
ever stop and inside of this we've

228
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,800
basically got our output variable which

229
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,519
uh starts off as a blank string as you

230
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
can see here and we're basically telling

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,279
setting it to whatever it already was

232
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
plus uh the next line in from the

233
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,720
iterator of the lines of our buffer

234
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,800
reader and then we're adding a new line

235
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,120
basically what this means is infinitely

236
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,480
we'll keep you know using this iterator

237
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
from the reader and we'll keep getting

238
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,959
the next line and the next line and the

239
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,200
next line the next line however when

240
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,959
there is no next line then what's going

241
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,519
to happen is the next function will

242
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,240
actually just throw a no such element

243
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,279
exception and once it throws this

244
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,120
exception we're going to be out of scope

245
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,800
of this while and we're going to be

246
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,680
inside of our catch block and since

247
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
there's no code in our catch block we're

248
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,519
basically catching our exception and

249
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,560
then dropping

250
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,600
we ignore it completely because we know

251
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,920
that's basically how we're stopping our

252
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,079
Loop and then we're able to return the

253
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,839
output variable and that means we are

254
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,760
completely finished executing our code

255
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,959
and now we have run the shell command

256
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,200
successfully and gotten our output and

257
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,079
then that can be used to do really

258
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,160
anything we would like to and so then in

259
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,440
the main static function all I do is I

260
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,200
print out to the screen the output of

261
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,680
the Run shell function when I run the

262
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,800
root be add two numbers on rb23 command

263
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,160
so now if I run this as you should see

264
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,800
uh it says five to me in this little

265
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,920
console here uh and I mean just for

266
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,839
example if I were to say a few different

267
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,040
numbers maybe uh through four and three

268
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,800
uh it should give me uh I'm just going

269
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
to save my file and then as you can see

270
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,399
it gives me seven and I could type in

271
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,720
any two numbers any two numbers I'd like

272
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,160
to and it should be able to give me the

273
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,839
output for that uh for that addition

274
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,240
problem and that is how you can call

275
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,320
Ruby code from java now though let's get

276
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,920
back to the Whiteboard part where I'm

277
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,560
going to show you how you can create a

278
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,519
Swift and python code Bridge let's get

279
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,200
to it all right so welcome back to the

280
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,440
whiteo part and now that you've seen how

281
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,519
you can Bridge Java and Ruby now let's

282
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,240
take a look at how you can Bridge Swift

283
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,040
and python code now quite surprisingly

284
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
and quite uh amazingly and quite um I

285
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,320
guess you could say easy easily for us

286
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,200
developers or it's quite convenient how

287
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,600
guess what all we need to do in order to

288
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,720
Swift Java I mean uh Swift uh sorry uh

289
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Bridge Swift and python code is replace

290
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,920
Java and Ruby with

291
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,440
Swift and

292
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,040
python but why is this well let's take a

293
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,399
look now let's say we've got a python

294
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,360
scrip that again add the numbers two and

295
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,839
three now the way you would run this is

296
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,880
you would go to your terminal and you

297
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,040
would type in

298
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,120
Python uh let's just say

299
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,839
script.py and you would say 2 3 then it

300
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,279
would output five and then you're back

301
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,040
to a

302
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,880
terminal so this proves that python is

303
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,040
based off of

304
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,360
bash now something else that's very

305
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
interesting here is you're saying hey

306
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,160
what well Swift isn't based off of bash

307
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,000
well that's why I'm here to talk to you

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,560
about Mac iOS apps or uh sorry Mac uh

309
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,120
Swift apps now you can actually create

310
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,000
command line tools or you can create

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,519
command line applications in Swift for

312
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,720
Mac OS and so the way you would run

313
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,519
those is you would have your terminal

314
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,720
and you would say Swift for example um

315
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,320
some binary file like uh Swift my

316
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,760
app okay and then you would say

317
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
23 and then 2 three will be the input

318
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,320
and the application can use that input

319
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,519
and then of course you would receive

320
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,440
five from Swift and then you can

321
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,240
continue dot dot dot do whatever you

322
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,880
want to in your

323
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,920
shell uh and so uh that's basically what

324
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,000
we're going to be doing today we're

325
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,079
going to compile some of our Swift code

326
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,800
into a binary uh or at least we could

327
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,839
compile it into a binary and have python

328
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:55,360
call it using its shell capability uh

329
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,040
but in this case what I'm going to do is

330
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,240
I'm actually going to be using using our

331
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,839
python script and I'm going to be

332
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,240
calling my python script from my Swift

333
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,560
code from my iOS sorry my Mac OS Swift

334
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,480
Code so now let's get right back over to

335
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,240
the code part where I'm going to be

336
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,639
showing you how you can create a bridge

337
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,639
between Swift and python let's get to

338
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,000
that all right so now I'm going to be

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,320
showing you how you can implement the

340
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,000
bridge between Java and Ruby all right

341
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,399
so let's take a look so to begin let me

342
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,880
show you the extremely simple Ruby

343
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
script that we're going to be using

344
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,000
today now first of all just we actually

345
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,839
get to the Ruby script though I like to

346
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,120
show you I have this little Java project

347
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,320
ready called Call Ruby code and this

348
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,519
Java product uh is actually quite simple

349
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,880
and what I've done is I've actually gone

350
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,320
into a terminal window and cded into

351
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,800
this directory if you've seen the list

352
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,399
here uh we've got of course as you know

353
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,680
by default the bin and Source Direct R

354
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,639
uh but we've also got this script called

355
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,920
add to numbers. RB if I open it up as

356
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,279
you can see it's a very very simple Ruby

357
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,480
script inside of the Java projects

358
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,759
directory uh and basically all we do

359
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,480
here is we print to the screen or put to

360
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,639
the screen uh the first argument that it

361
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,920
was given to an integer plus the second

362
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,680
argument it was given to an integer now

363
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,600
basically what this means uh is we're

364
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,079
taking both of the arguments that was

365
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,639
given via the command line and we are

366
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,120
converting them to integers adding them

367
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,399
together and putting them back onto the

368
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,800
screen once that's done you should have

369
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
a very simple Ruby script that can do

370
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,480
this so if you type in Ruby add2

371
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,560
numbers. rb23 it should give you five if

372
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,240
you were to write 50,000 maybe 25,000

373
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,160
which should give you 7500 uh 75,000

374
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,759
sorry uh so you can just you know add in

375
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,560
put any two numbers here and it will add

376
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,800
them up uh except for decimals you have

377
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,839
to put in integers uh and it should be

378
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,959
able to add them up and give you your

379
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,560
output now basically let's just say you

380
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,480
wanted to call this code from java how

381
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,360
would you do that well it's actually

382
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,079
quite simple now the first thing you

383
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,880
need to do is make Java available to ACC

384
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,040
actually access the shell environment

385
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,600
and the way we can do that is by

386
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,560
implementing my very own little run

387
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,079
shell function the Run shell function

388
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,319
returns a string but it also takes a

389
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,120
string called command and this is the

390
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,680
actual shell command that you'd like to

391
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,639
run and this function can throw an

392
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,240
exception

393
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,759
now inside here as you can see I'm

394
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,720
defining the output variable and this is

395
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,680
basically a string that contains the

396
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,279
final output for the

397
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,040
user or technically what came from our

398
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,800
shell command once that's done I'm

399
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,959
creating a new process called execution

400
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,199
process and we're setting this execution

401
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,440
process to a new runtime execution

402
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,519
process and we're giving it the command

403
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,319
that you gave for that shell command

404
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,639
then what we're doing is we're telling

405
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,000
it to wait for this process to be done

406
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,399
because what we've just gone ahead and

407
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,000
done is we've given that I guess you

408
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,360
could say execution Handler uh to a

409
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,280
different process but what we're doing

410
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,959
is we're telling this process to wait

411
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,039
for itself to be done and then we'll

412
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,280
continue with the rest of the Java code

413
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,000
and so once that is done we take that

414
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,120
execution process and we get it input

415
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,839
stream and we put that into a new

416
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,919
variable called is we then create a new

417
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,360
input stream reader called is reader uh

418
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,400
based off of that input stream and then

419
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,280
we create a buffered reader called

420
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,400
reader from that input stream reader uh

421
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
and this is a new buffer reader instance

422
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,240
then there's a little bit of logic that

423
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,679
we use in order to extract all of the

424
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,120
lines from our buffer reader into our

425
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,400
output

426
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,240
variable now this is a little bit of I

427
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,280
guess you could say workaround each

428
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,799
logic uh and it's not recommended for

429
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,760
your applications necessarily but it

430
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,640
should work in really every single

431
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,960
circumstance so I'm not exactly uh I

432
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,120
mean it

433
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,640
it's not bad basically uh but the way

434
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,159
this works uh is essentially we are

435
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,480
using exceptions to our advantage I

436
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,799
guess you could say uh so inside of our

437
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,679
Tri catch here uh I have inside of the

438
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,120
tri block uh an infinite Loop a while

439
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,080
true Loop which is infinitely going on

440
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,200
it'll never ever stop and inside of this

441
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
we've basically got our output variable

442
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
which uh starts off as a blank string as

443
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
you can see here and we're basically

444
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,640
telling setting it to whatever it

445
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,159
already was

446
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:32,799
plus uh the next line in from the

447
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,600
iterator of the lines of our buffered

448
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,679
reader and then we're adding a new line

449
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,960
basically what this means is infinitely

450
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,400
we'll keep you know using this iterator

451
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
from the reader and we'll keep getting

452
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,840
the next line and the next line and the

453
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,080
next line the next line however when

454
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,799
there is no next line then what's going

455
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,400
to happen is the next function will

456
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,520
actually just throw a no such element

457
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,080
exception

458
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,000
and once it throws this exception we're

459
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,080
going to be out of scope of this while

460
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,200
and we're going to be inside of our

461
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,320
catch block and since there's no code in

462
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,720
our catch block we're basically catching

463
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,559
our exception and then dropping it we

464
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,440
ignore it completely because we know

465
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,760
that's basically how we're stopping our

466
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,919
Loop and then we're able to return the

467
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,720
output variable and that means we are

468
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,600
completely finished executing our code

469
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,840
and now we have run the shell command

470
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,039
successfully and gotten our output and

471
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,919
then that can be used to do really

472
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,000
anything we would like to and so then in

473
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,320
the main static function all I do is I

474
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,080
print out to the screen the output of

475
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,640
the Run shell function when I run the

476
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,919
Ruby add to numbers on rb23 command so

477
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,200
now if I run this as you should see uh

478
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,640
it says five to me in this little

479
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,799
console here uh and I mean just for

480
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,720
example if I were to say a few different

481
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,240
numbers maybe uh four and three uh it

482
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,080
should give me uh I'm just going to save

483
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,880
my file and then as you can see gives me

484
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,679
seven and I could type in any two

485
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,400
numbers any two numbers I'd like to and

486
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,080
it should be able to give me the output

487
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,679
for that uh for that addition

488
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,080
problem and that is how you can call

489
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,159
Ruby code from java now though let's get

490
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,760
back to the Whiteboard part where I'm

491
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,400
going to show you how you can create a

492
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Swift and python code Bridge let's get

493
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,679
to it all right so now that you've seen

494
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,039
how you can Bridge Java and Ruby as well

495
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,799
as Swift and python we are now ready to

496
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,559
move to the last and argu arguably the

497
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,720
most important Bridge of them all how

498
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,840
you can use Swift to bridge with myql

499
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,120
using PHP in between let's talk about

500
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,880
that now we're basically using in this

501
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,720
case MySQL for things like user data

502
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,320
okay uh or really anything any storage

503
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
for your application uh in this case

504
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,159
would be handled by

505
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,480
MySQL uh and essentially the point here

506
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,679
uh is that we

507
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,200
are sorry uh so basically what we're

508
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
going to do is let's just say we've got

509
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,840
Swift and this Swift is running on an

510
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,840
IOS app and this IOS app is something

511
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,559
like a chatting app okay uh and

512
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,080
basically you've

513
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,559
got all the messages and everything of

514
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,520
that sort on my my

515
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,640
SQL okay got messages user data

516
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,840
everything about your application on

517
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,559
MySQL now you need to find a way to

518
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,679
communicate between Swift and MySQL but

519
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
there's no direct way to do that so you

520
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
have to use a programming language

521
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,120
bridge and the way that I like to do

522
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,000
this is well a very simple PHP bridge

523
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,840
now what does this mean well basically

524
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,960
what this means is that with PHP we can

525
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,440
easily get a direct connection to myql

526
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,799
up and running in no time and that means

527
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,039
that PHP is capable of very very easily

528
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,960
communicating to and from my

529
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,799
SQL and I can very easily again make

530
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,200
Swift communicate with PHP as well but

531
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
how would we do that it's quite simple

532
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,760
all we need to do is set up a rest and

533
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,240
point Point such as

534
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,760
get I mean you could use post request

535
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,880
delete request put request anything I'm

536
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,320
using get in this case since it's the

537
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,320
simplest to create so a get request for

538
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,720
slash maybe you know insert or you know

539
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,960
register and this would take a few

540
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,200
parameters like username password date

541
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,240
of birth etc etc etc and then what would

542
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,279
happen is we would use Swift and we

543
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:59,080
would basically

544
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,760
contact PHP using this endpoint and PHP

545
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,080
would you know do its MySQL logic go to

546
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,400
mySQL do whatever it needs to then MySQL

547
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,240
is going to come back to PHP and Swift

548
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,919
will get the result to get that uh uh

549
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
get the result of that rest call that it

550
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
made to PHP and in this way it basically

551
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,559
becomes a rest API that your application

552
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,679
is based off of and it becomes extremely

553
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,279
extremely convenient to work with and so

554
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,360
that is basically how this bridge Works

555
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,720
uh in fact if you'd actually like to see

556
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,120
a live example of how this works with a

557
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,640
friend list app uh then of course you

558
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
can actually visit my video in fact one

559
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,039
of my one of my first video is called

560
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,720
Swift databases uh and I've actually

561
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,039
created an entire series about this with

562
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,320
then they all highlight how you can use

563
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,200
that Swift PHP MySQL bridge in fact I've

564
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,880
even created I guess you could say this

565
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,840
framework called tql kit and there will

566
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,559
be a link to that video as well in the

567
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,640
description and that basically allows

568
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,400
you to skip the worrying and the logic

569
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,000
of that PHP Bridge it allows you to run

570
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,120
native MySQL code on inside of Swift

571
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,880
that will go through PHP in the

572
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,559
background and will hit a remote MySQL

573
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,600
server and get back to you with a

574
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
response it's really really interesting

575
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,600
what it does and of course I really do

576
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
recommend that you check the those all

577
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,000
out and links to those will be in the

578
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,720
