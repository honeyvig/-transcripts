hello everyone welcome to another video
by simply learn in this video we will
learn about arduino
the arduino platform has grown in
popularity among those just getting
started with electronics and for good
purpose
in contrast to the majority of earlier
programmable circuit boards to load new
code onto the arduino you don't need a
separate piece of hardware all you just
need is a usb cable
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
click on the bell icon so you never miss
an update from simply that so without
any further ado let's get started
what is arduino
arduino is an open source electronic
gadget that treats input such as light
on a sensor a finger on a button or a
tweet and generates output based on
those inputs such as turning on an led
or activating a motor
arduino was created at the design
institute as a simple tool for students
with no career experience with
electronics or programming
arduino boards are microcontrollers not
entire computers with operating system
of their own like the raspberry pi
arduino just run c or c plus plus code
that is stored in the firmware
the arduino ide is free software that
allows you to create and upload code on
an arduino board
why arduino
arduino has been used in millions of
projects and applications due to its
simple and accessible user interface
the arduino software is simple to use
for beginners but it is customizable for
advanced users
it works on mac windows and linux
systems
arduino is a valuable tool for learning
new skills anyone including youngsters
amateurs artists and programmers can
begin tinkering by simply following the
step-by-step instructions
it can be used by teachers and students
to create low-cost scientific equipments
to demonstrate chemistry and physics
principles and to begin learning
programming and robotics
designers and architects create
interactive prototypes
while musicians and artists create
installations and try out new
instruments
features of arduino
arduino has microcontroller of at mega
328 and the operating voltage is 5 volts
whereas the input voltage is recommended
to be from 7 to 12 volts and input
voltage limits from 6 to 20 volts
we have digital input output pins
that is we have 14 pins
and we have analog input 6 pins
and we have dc current per input output
pin 40 milli ampere
and dc current for 3.3 volt pen is 50
milliamperes and we have flash memory of
32 kilobytes
and we have sram of 2 kb
and eep rom of 1 kb
and we have clock speed of 16 megahertz
now let us look at the different types
of arduino boards present firstly we
have arduino uno
arduino uno includes everything you will
need to get started it has 14 digital
input output pins 6 analog input a usb
port a power jack and a reset button
among other features it comes with
everything you will need to get started
with the microcontroller plug into a
computer with usb cable or power it with
an ac to dc adapter or battery
next we have lily pad arduino lily pad
is variable e-textile device created by
lee
and designed in collaboration with
sparkfun each lily pad was cleverly
constructed with large connection pads
and a flat back to sew conductive thread
into garments
in addition the daily pad features its
own set of input output power and sensor
boards designed exclusively for
e-textiles and can even be washed
arduino mega the arduino mega is the
larger brother of arduino uno it
contains many digital input output pins
that is 54
and 16 analog inputs a usb connection a
power jack and a reset button it comes
with everything you will need to get
started with microcontroller plug it
into a computer with usb cable or power
it with ac to dc adapter or a battery
red board arduino
the arduino ide can program the red
board over the use of mini b connector
it will run on windows 8 without
requiring changes to your security
settings
because of the usb chip we used it's
more sturdy and it's fully flat on the
back making it easier to integrate into
your projects
and we have arduino leonardo
the leonardo is arduino's initial
development board with a single
microcontroller and usb port
as a result it may be less expensive and
easier additionally because the board
handles usb directly code libraries are
available that allow the board to
imitate a computer keyboard mouse and
other components
now let us look at the advantages of
arduino
in comparison to the other
microcontroller system arduino boards
are comparatively affordable the
arduino's module is cheapest version can
be assembled by hand and even pre-made
arduino module cost less than 50 dollars
for windows macintosh os x and linux the
arduino software ide is provided the
vast majority of microcontroller systems
are windows only compatible
the arduino software is simple for
beginners but it's also flexible enough
for advanced users
for experienced programmers the arduino
software is available as an open source
tool to extend
people who want to learn more about the
language can use c plus libraries and
those who want to learn more about
technicals specifics can switch from
arduino to avrc programming language
the arduino is an open source and has
hardware that can be expanded the
arduino board blueprints are made
available under creative common license
allowing experienced circuits designers
to create their module version extending
and upgrading it
at last we will look at the
disadvantages of arduino
arduino cannot run multiple programs at
a time
no memory safety checks expensive for
cpu power and memory
it has lack of built-in communications
lack of built-in peripherals
the limited number of programming
languages
and a limited number of ides
blocking projects using arduino
frequently we need to secure a space in
our home or business so that no one can
enter without our permission and our
valuable accessories and assets are
protected from theft or loss
there are many different types of
security systems available today
but they all rely on finger prints
retina scanners iris scanners face id
tongue scanners rfid readers password
pins patterns and other biometrics for
authentication
the most cost effective solution is to
utilize an arduino-based password or pin
based system
some of the locking projects using
arduino are arduino door lock system
rfid and keyboard lock system
we have unlocked door with knock system
push button lock system and gesture
control dock using arduino
then we have rover projects using
arduino
the arduino robot is the world's first
arduino powered vehicle
on each of robot's two boards there are
two cpus the motor board is in charge of
the motors while the control board is in
charge of reading sensors and deciding
how to run them
each board is a complete arduino board
that can be programmed using arduino ide
using arduino we can create many rover
projects like voice control rover
line follower rover
gesture control rover
survey rover
ir remote control rover
and similarly
we have autonomous rover
and many more
game projects using arduino

what is arduino
arduino is an open source electronic
gadget that reads inputs such as light
on a sensor a finger on a button or a
tweet and generates output based on
those inputs such as turning on the led
or activating a motor
arduino was created at a design
institute as a simple tool for students
with no prior experience with
electronics and programming
arduino boards are microcontrollers not
entire computers with operating systems
of their own like the raspberry pi
arduino just run c c plus plus code that
is stored in the firmware
the arduino ide integrated development
environment is free software that allows
you to create and upload code to an
arduino board
now let us see what is raspberry pi
raspberry pi is small low cost computer
the size of a credit card that connects
to a computer monitor or television and
utilizes a conventional keyboard and a
mouse
raspberry pi can do everything a desktop
computer does including accessing the
internet
using raspberry pi we can watch high
definition videos access spreadsheets
word processing and play games
raspberry pi has a dedicated processor
memory and a graphics driver just like a
pc it also comes with its own operating
system raspberry pi operating system
which is a modified version of linux
raspberry pi is also used in music
machines parent detectors as well as
weather stations and tweeting bird
houses with infrared cameras
let us look at the comparison between
arduino versus raspberry pi first let us
look at the control unit
arduino is a member of atmega family of
microcontrollers
a microcontroller chip common on arduino
uno boats is atmega328
the 8-bit avr microcontroller family
includes atmega328 microcontrollers
a surface mount at mega chip is seen on
some arduino uno boards
the raspberry pi is an arm controller
unit
broadcom chips based on arms cortex a
application processor have powered
raspberry pi from its release
the raspberry pi 3 is the latest version
of the raspberry pi
launched in february 2016.
it has 1.2 gigahertz amp cortex a53 cpu
making it compatible for the arm 63.
it has 1.2 gigahertz arm cortex a53 cpu
making it compatible for the arm 64
architecture
architecture
the harvard architecture is used by
arduino cpu which means that the program
code and the program data have distinct
memory
it is made up of two types of memories
program memory and data memory the data
is saved in the data memory while the
code is kept in the flash program memory
whereas in raspberry pi raspberry pi
contains a single core arm v6 processor
running at 700 megahertz
a video core 4 gpu and 512 mb of ram
its operating system and data are stored
on sd card
raspbian a lightweight linux operating
system based on debian is officially
supported by the raspberry pi
licensing
arduino is an open source electronics
platform that uses simple hardware and
software to make it easy to use
it's for everyone who wants to make
interactive projects
arduino perceives the environment by
receiving data from a variety of sensors
and actuators to influence its
surroundings
raspberry pi's hardware and software are
both proprietary raspberry pi has never
claimed to be open source
many aspects of it particularly the
software are open source but not all of
it is
the raspberry pi has been criticized for
having close source components
operating system
arduino boards are single board
microcontrollers with firmware and no
operating system
a firmware program is a piece of
software that is installed on hardware
device
it doesn't have an operating system but
it does have a firmware which can be
programmed using several ides including
the arduino ide
raspberry pi operating system for pc and
mac is dbn with raspberry pi desktop
it installs a raspberry pi operating
system desktop on pc or apple mac as
well as most of the recommended software
that comes with raspberry pi operating
system
now let us look at the specifications
so we look at the specifications between
arduino uno r3 and raspberry pi 3 model
b plus
so if you look at the system arduino has
microcontroller system whereas raspberry
pi has single boarded computer processor
arduino has avr at mega 328p and
raspberry pi has broadcom
ram
in arduino uno we have ram of 2 kb
whereas in raspberry pi model 3 b plus
we have 1gb ram
clock speed 16 megahertz in arduino and
1.4 gigahertz in raspberry pi
execution in arduino single program can
be executed at a time
whereas in raspberry pi multiple
programs can run at a time
current
current is 5 milli ampere in both
arduino and raspberry pi and gpu io pins
arduino has 20 and raspberry pi has 40.
and power consumption in arduino is 175
milliwatt and in raspberry pi it is 700
milliwatt
applications
arduino is used in waving machines
traffic light countdown timer parking
lot counter embedded systems home
automation industrial automation medical
instrument and emergency light for
railways
whereas raspberry pi is used in desktop
pc wireless usage game servers retro
gaming machine robot controller stop
motion camera and time lapse camera
now let us look at the different types
of arduino and raspberry pi
in arduino we have arduino uno
lily pad arduino arduino mega arduino
leonardo arduino red board and arduino
shields
whereas in raspberry pi
we have raspberry pi one model b
raspberry pi one model a
model b plus model a plus
then we have raspberry pi zero raspberry
pi 2 raspberry pi zero w and raspberry
pi 3 model p
and we know a raspberry pi which is
better the arduino and raspberry pi have
their own set of benefits and drawbacks
the best option for you will be
determined by the requirement of your
project and your budget
arduino is ideal for automating
repetitive operations such as opening
and closing doors turning on and off
lights and so on
arduino should be the first pick if your
project has any repeating elements and
just requires generating output
depending on sensory inputs
raspberry pi is ideally suited for
complex activities such as controlling
complex robots weather monitoring and
internet publishing among others
if your project necessitates advanced
functionality as well as internet access
then the raspberry pi is the option
