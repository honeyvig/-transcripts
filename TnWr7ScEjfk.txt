1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,330
this is my Nana my grandpa one week ago

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,700
on March 27 very unfortunately he passed

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,130
away in India and sadly we couldn't be

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,410
there with him why couldn't we be there

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,259
with him because travel is unsafe unwise

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,839
and therefore lockdown due to the novel

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,480
coronavirus just like our family the

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,270
entire world is suffering as of April

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,640
3rd there are over a million confirmed

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,039
cases worldwide in New York City

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,619
they're experiencing more consistent 911

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,810
calls and then during 9/11 and the

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,579
secretary-general of the United Nations

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,980
Antonio Guterres says this is the

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,660
greatest test to have faced together

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,460
since the formation of the United

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,010
Nations we are in a situation that we've

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,410
never faced the floor as a species which

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,700
may lead you to believe that there's

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,649
nothing that the average person can do

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,750
but that couldn't be further from the

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,219
truth

23
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,329
everybody this is dr. Don Halberstadt

24
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,730
conventional wisdom has it that the self

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,340
quarantine will decrease the spread of

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,489
the virus and decrease the density of

27
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,949
cases within a specific area please do

28
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,229
your job and stay home to protect our

29
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,210
children the elderly and our most

30
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,549
vulnerable populations get this right

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,280
yet we are all links in a chain of

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,750
humanity and we need to delink for a

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,240
little while for this virus to stop

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,640
spreading it's as simple as that

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,470
remember with pandemic threats to public

36
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,360
health it's not only about whether you

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,130
get it it's just as much about whether

38
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,689
you'll give it to someone else it's

39
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,790
vital to prevent the spread of this

40
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,640
disease as it thrives and what makes its

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,490
most human social contact I believe this

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,869
is important as it gives us the best

43
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,000
chance at saving as many lives as

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,040
possible and personally I want to thank

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,780
everyone because I am immunocompromised

46
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,659
and I am a mother and my goal is to be

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,790
around a long time

48
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,159
stay at home help flatten the curve and

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,259
let's stop this pandemic together no

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,079
matter what it is impossible to get 100%

51
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,500
participation in self quarantine people

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,689
need to go to the grocery store they

53
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,640
need to go to the pharmacy to get their

54
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,500
medicines they need to go to see their

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,370
doctor

56
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,440
because of that it's important to ensure

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,510
that you're taking the right precautions

58
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,980
these include no handshakes covering

59
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,739
coughed or sneeze disinfecting

60
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,530
frequently touch surfaces packages and

61
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,989
Mail that come to you I keep 6 feet of

62
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,360
distance wash your hands thoroughly for

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,090
20 seconds with soap and water

64
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,410
personally I believe there's one thing

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,450
we can all do that will show the most

66
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,730
appreciation for those working for us in

67
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,890
the midst of the pandemic this includes

68
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,049
health care workers food providers those

69
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:45,360
at grocery stores and the journalists

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
risking their lives to make sure we're

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,730
all well informed stay home that's it

72
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,040
that's the ultimate display of gratitude

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
by ensuring you're not out there getting

74
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,049
infected and infecting others you're

75
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,450
making their lives safer better and are

76
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,940
thanking them for their service only by

77
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,379
staying apart will we come together

78
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,239
again the countries that make this a

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,519
slow pandemic with very little spread of

80
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,379
the virus won't be remembered by the

81
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,329
history books and that's exactly what we

82
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,879
want so let's all do our part work

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,819
together stay at home and make it as fun

84
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,519
as you can I live in Canada and I'd like

85
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,410
to specifically appreciate the response

86
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,840
of a Canadian government by providing

87
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,630
wage subsidies funding kids help them to

88
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,859
help the youth and their mental health

89
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,739
funding the United Way banning travel

90
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,959
enforcing social distancing closing

91
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,120
schools and funding research efforts

92
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,079
they have proven to be world leaders in

93
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,459
coronavirus response thank you for

94
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,859
making a positive impact or you can cut

95
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:44,880
it with your friends you could play

96
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,680
Dungeons and Dragons online play board

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,780
games video chat with your grandparents

98
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,919
or relatives you haven't reached out to

99
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,650
in a while or maybe even teaching your

100
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,419
pet a new trick good job there you go

101
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,579
yeah a great example of what you can do

102
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,380
with all your extra time the community

103
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,200
is really coming together to help solve

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,139
this crisis for example the folding at

105
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,299
home supercomputer Network has crossed

106
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,359
the exaflop barrier making it faster

107
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,389
than the top 25 supercomputers in the

108
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,930
world combined that's a lot of power and

109
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,299
you too can donate spare computing power

110
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,290
and idle seek

111
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,570
you cycles just by clicking a couple of

112
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,000
buttons remember every floating-point

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,510
operation counts the research done with

114
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,190
the folding at home supercomputer

115
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,200
network is going to go towards the fight

116
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,400
against coronavirus

117
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,450
you
