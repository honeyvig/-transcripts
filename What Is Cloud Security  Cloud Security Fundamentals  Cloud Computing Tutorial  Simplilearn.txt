hey everyone welcome back to our video
by simply learn today we are going to
talk about something super important
Cloud security if you new to the world
of cloud computing don't worry I'm here
to explain in the simplest way possible
imagine you've got a collection of
valuable items you wouldn't leave them
just lying around unpredicted right
instead you would log them up in a
Secure Vault Cloud security Works in a
similar way but instead of physical
items we are talking about data
applications and services that are
stored on the internet now you might be
wondering why should I care about Cloud
security well by 2028 businesses that
aren't using Cloud Tech might as well as
be living in the Stone Age but here's
the catch all the valuable stuff in the
cloud it's a tempting Target for hackers
so whether you are a solo coder or a big
company taking Cloud secure seriously
can make or break your success in this
video we will break down the basics of
cloud security why is it so important
and how you can keep your Cloud
environment secure whether you're a
small business owner or just starting
out in the tech World understanding
Cloud security is essential so let's
dive in and get

whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we commence if you are
interested in becoming a cloud architect
look no further simply learns Cloud
architect certification courses your
pathway to mastering AWS this course is
aligned with the latest exam announced
by AWS and you will learn how to design
and scale AWS cloud implementations with
the best practices recommended by Amazon
explore the basic ideas and tools of
these important Cloud platforms this
will help you make strong reliable
applications our complete training will
quickly make you skilled in cloud
computing don't miss out the chance to
change your career in Cloud architecture
with simply learn so without further Ado
let's get started so let us first
understand what exactly is cloud
security Cloud security is a set of
tools and practices designed to protect
businesses from threats both inside and
outside the organiz ization as companies
move to use more online tools and
services ensuring their Cloud security
is essential let's start with a simple
case study imagine an IT consulting firm
the owner Alex decides to move the
company's operation to the cloud to
streamline project management client
interactions and data storage Alex
chooses a cloud service provider to host
all the data and application but here's
the thing the internet can be a
dangerous place just like you would want
to protect your home from burglar Alex
needs to protect his business from cyber
criminals who might try to steal
sensitive client data or disrupt
services this is where Cloud security
comes in Cloud security involves using
various tools and practices to keep your
data safe ensure only authorized people
can access it and protect it from the
potential threats for Alex this means
making sure that the client's
information is encrypted so even if
someone intercepts it they can't read it
setting up strong passwords and
multiactor authentication to make sure
only the right people have access and
regularly updating software to fix any
security weaknesses so in simple terms
Cloud security is like having a
high-tech security system for your
online and data applications it's about
making sure your valuable information is
safe and sound just like you would
protect your most prized possession
but why is cloud security so important
lately terms like digital transformation
and Cloud migration are often heard in
businesses these terms means different
things to different companies but then
they both highlight the need to change
as businesses adopt these new
technologies to improve their operations
they face new challenges in keeping
everything secure while maintaining
productivity modern Technologies allows
businesses to work Beyond traditional
off office setups but switching to
cloud-based systems can be risky if not
done correctly to get the best results
businesses needs to understand how to
use these Technologies safely and
effectively this means finding the right
balance between using Advanced Cloud
tools and ensuring strong security
practices are in the place before we
jump in let's talk briefly why the cloud
is such a game changer cloud computing
offers on demand self-service broad
network access access rapid elasticity
and scalable resources making it
incredibly convenient for businesses you
can access resources from anywhere scale
up or down based on your needs and enjoy
a flexible and efficient Computing
environment however these benefits can
introduce unique security challenges
that needs to be addressed data breaches
encryption is your best friend make sure
that your data is encrypted both at rest
and Transit think of it like this if
someone steals a lock box but doesn't
have the key they can't access what's
inside access controls only authorized
users can access sensitive data use Ro
based access control rbac and multiactor
authentication MFA to make this happen
it's like having a bouncer at a VIP
party only the right people get in then
we have insecure apis secure coding
practices always use secure coding
practices to protect your apis validate
inputs and use proper authentication
it's like making sure your doors and
windows are locked tight regular audits
regularly audit your apis for
vulnerabilities think of it as a routine
checkup to keep everything is on top
shape then we have Insider threats to
overcome this we have monitoring
activities keep an eye on what's
happening within your organization use
monitoring tools to detect unusual
activities it's like having secure
cameras inside your premises employee
training educate your employees about
Security's best practices sometimes the
simple mistake can lead to big problems
training is the first line of defense
the next threat we have is the denial of
service attacks traffic management use
traffic management tools to filter out
malicious traffic it's like having a
flood gate to control the flow of water
and keep out the bad stuff rency and
load balancing Implement Riden
and load balancing to ensure your system
can handle sudden spikes in traffic it's
like having multiple Lanes on a highway
to prevent traffic jams then we have
advanced persistent threats
APS to overcome this we should ensure
continuous monitoring always monitor
your system for any signs of intrusion
use Advanced security measures to detect
and respond to threats quickly think of
it as having a night Watchman on duty 24
into 7 then we have incident response
plans having a plan in place to respond
to security incidents it's like having
an emergency drill you'll know exactly
what to do if something goes wrong best
practices here are some of the best
practices to enhance Cloud security at
first Implement strong access controls
use multiactor authentication and limit
access based on rules to ensure that
users only have the permission they need
regularly update and path systems keep
your systems up to date with the latest
patches to close vulnerabilities that
could be exploited by attackers then we
have employee training educate your
employees on Security's best practices
such as recognizing fishing attempts and
creating strong passwords then we have
Network segmentation divide your network
into smaller more secure zones to limit
the impact of potential breaches
monitoring and logging continuously
monitor your environment and maintain
detailed logs to detect and respond to
threats promptly Cloud security is an
ongoing effort that requires vigilance
right tools and a commitment to best
practices by staying informed using the
right security measures and following
best practices you can protect your
Cloud environment from threats so this
