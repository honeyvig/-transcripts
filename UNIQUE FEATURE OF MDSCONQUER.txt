yes hi everyone uh this is Dr strian
from Team MDS
conquer I'm here to explain few
important things related to your
preparation
phase for any preparation to be
successful on the day of result you need
to have few
things in your preparation those are
very important one is a plan and second
one is how you prepare how you prepare
your notes how you prepare to the exam
and third one is your performance in the
exam and Hall this Triad of P3 okay that
is a plan preparation and performance
plays a very important role in the
success of an
examination so going in detail first of
all I want to talk about schedule that
is the your plan is a very
important
because preparation nowadays is is a
tricky tricky aspect because you are
stuffed with lots of factors other than
reading
book okay and in specific test series
like online test series nowadays they
are more common compared to the
classroom Based
Teaching because you you cannot have a a
constant phase of preparation throughout
the matter of 10 or 12 months if you
take these three first three graphs the
I mean graphically it is very beautiful
but it is impossible to maintain the
same phase from day one to till last or
it is very difficult to maintain a
constant phase or it's very difficult to
increase the preparation phase
drastically which cannot be
possible so basing upon the survey
conducted by by by the team MDS conquer
uh from The Toppers of all India as well
as the Toppers of State particularly
focusing on online based coaching that
is more important because you cannot
compare a classroom based coaching to an
online based coaching one you cannot
compare a mother who is preparing for an
entrance having two kids who's a dentist
and can not be compared to your
preparation having an interns with less
responsibilities you cannot compare them
okay of course the neat people in the
final list they compare but majority of
the people what they will be is they
will be on this side and few people they
will be on that side logically speaking
it cannot be comparable because we are
in a country where Customs are given
more values rather than anything right
so basing upon the survey conducted uh
the conquer team has concluded to come
out with a different strategy in the
schedule of an
examination if you see this this is what
my strategy is you will start your
preparation very slow for example if you
take if you take a riding a bike into
consideration you will start slow in the
first gear then you will move to the
fourth gear as days progress or as you
move onto your distance so that's what
should be included in your preparation
phase also it's not like 7 days one
subject followed by 7 Days other subject
you cannot do that it is impossible
again you need to modify your schedule
according to that so on this I came to a
conclusion that you need to start very
slow at one point then you need to have
a directly proportional area then you
need to take a break maintaining the
preparation phase constantly for a
particular duration of time again you
have to increase and again you have to
maintain a constant phase the most
advantage of this mode of preparation is
even if you have any sort of issues in
your preparation phase like your health
issue or an emotional issue or if you
have a function or some occas in your
family you have some time to cope up
with the schedule and come back to the
frequency again okay because I've SE
majority of my students in the past four
years quitting the preparation because
of a silly reason sir I'm not feeling
well from past 10 days then after I feel
like I can't catch up the schedule I
have quitted the preparation there is an
occasion like my sister or brother
marriage is there I took a leave of 15
20 days then I quitted my preparation
this should not happen because this mode
of preparation but this mode of
scheduling is going to increase your
accuracy and is going to maintain the
confidence levels and is going to give
ample amount of time where your backlogs
can be revised recapped and can be
completed so this is a special pattern
of scheduling which is very unique only
with MDS
contract and coming to the schedule and
the exams that you will go through
during this phase of preparation is the
first exam that you are going to give is
your as
November followed by the next exam that
you're going to give is your December
neat and followed by the next year exams
will be May m 2020 and June PGA 2020 and
the subjects that you have to focus for
almost all the exams are the first year
second year third year and final year
subjects and apart from this a few more
medical subjects will be added to your
list which will be discussed in the
group don't worry about
that so again one more natural scenario
uh the pattern of preparation cannot be
completed until the last day of your
exam so this what this natural cycle of
moons is okay you can start your
preparation incomplete one way you're
going to be on the way on the way you
will have 80% T 90% then you'll hit 100%
T and the second mode way is this way
again you're going to complete this 100%
this is nothing but a revision in two
different direction okay one way and
two-way revision so two-way revision
concept is very very important in fact
once you're going through many subjects
a multi-directional revision is very
important to stand in this heavy
compettive exams like need that to
preparing at sitting at home
online so basing on this Hamas conquer
came to a conclusion with all the
scenarios and the surveys that the
revision is heart of the preparation and
the revision for the last 15 days should
be planned from day one of your
preparation so with this we came to an
understanding that we need to have at
least two to three rounds of revisions
in fact more than three rounds of
revision so guys don't get panic even if
you missed few subjects in the
discussion point of view from MDS
conquer or classes or by mistake even if
you have attended the classes but you
have not completed few tasks there may
be from backlog Parts which cannot be
covered as you go progress into the
preparation but here we have two rounds
of revision three rounds of revision
every subject will be done more than
three times that's what the plan of MDS
conquer team is so don't get panic even
if you're sick at one point don't quit
the preparation even if you have an
occasion which is unavoidable for
example if you have your own marriage
which you cannot avoid right so finish
it take one one and half month break
because there are unavoidable things
don't worry come back to the preparation
again give your best because every
subject will be done two or three
times for example if you're having a
brothers or a sister's marriage or if
you're feeling sick or any one of your
family is feeling sick where you need to
help them you need to escort them don't
worry guys come back to the preparation
again once you're free once you're done
with that's because every subject will
be done two to three times in MDS
conquer every McQ will be repeated two
to three times the main important fact
why we are doing this is the first draft
reveals the art whereas the revision
reveals the artist we want you to be on
the second half as the days increases
with the revision as the number of
revisions increases your confidence
levels while you're entering the
examination Hall will be more that is
the main aspect that I want you guys to
get more sort of revisions from your
side if you don't I'm going to do three
rounds of revision so that's what the
commitment or the promise that we as a
team we as a team giving to you guys
okay so even if you miss don't worry the
discussion will come back again even if
you join late don't worry don't don't
