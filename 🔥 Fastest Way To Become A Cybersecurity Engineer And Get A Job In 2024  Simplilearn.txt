in a world where digital security is as
crucial as a fortified Castle in
mediable times the role of a cyber
security engineer has never been more
vital did you know that by 2025 the
global cost of cyber crime is expected
to hit an astonishing $10.5 trillion
annually that's double the figure from
just a few years ago with each headline
the demand for skilled cyber security
engineers skyrockets and there's a 3.5
million unfulfilled cyber security jobs
predicted globally by 2025 the average
salary of a certified cyber security
engineer in the United States is
approximately $97,000 per year and it's
consistently one of the highest paying
it certifications but how does one
become a part of this Elite Force where
do you start and what's the fastest
route to not just enter But excel in

from digital attacks so these attacks
can include hacking breaches viruses and
various forms of cyber threats so now
we'll see the roles and responsibilities
of a cyber security engineer so first
role and responsibility for a cyber
security engineer is system protection
that is implementing and managing
Security Solutions to protected systems
networks and data this includes
firewalls antivirus software and
intrusion detection systems and then
comes threat assessment so continuously
monitoring and assessing the cyber
security or the security of computer
system and networks identifying
potential vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by hackers and then comes the
incident response so responding to and
