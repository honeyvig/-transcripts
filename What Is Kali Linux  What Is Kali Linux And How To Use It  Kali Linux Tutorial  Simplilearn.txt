hey everyone
it's no secret that the majority of our
internet usage is at the risk of being
hacked be it via unsafe messaging
applications or misconfigured operating
systems
to counteract this void of digital
security penetration testing has become
the knob when it comes to vulnerability
assessment
kali linux is an operating system that
has become a well-known weapon in this
fight against hackers
a linux distribution that is made
specifically for penetration testers
kali linux has layers of features that
we will be covering in today's lesson
let's take a look at the topics to be
covered in this video
we start by learning about kali linux
and a basic explanation of its purpose
we take a look at the history of kali
linux from the story of its origin to
its current day exploits
next we learn a few distinct features of
kali that make it an attractive choice
for penetration testers worldwide
finally we take a look at the multiple
ways we can install kali linux to start
our journey in the world of penetration
testing
let's start by learning about kali linux
in general
kali linux which is formerly known as
backtrack linux is an open source linux
distribution aimed at advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing
it contains several hundred tools that
are targeted towards various information
security tasks such as penetration
testing security research computer
forensics and reverse engineering
kali linux is a multiple platform
solution
accessible and freely available to
information security professionals and
hobbyists
among all the linux distributions kali
linux takes its roots from the debian
operating system debian has been a
highly dependable and stable
distribution for many years providing a
similarly strong foundation to the kali
desktop
while the operating system is capable of
practically modifying every single part
of our installation the networking
components of kali become disabled by
default this is done to prevent any
external factors from affecting the
installation procedure which may pose a
risk in critical environments
apart from boosting security it allows a
deeper element of control to the most
enthusiastic of users
we did not get kali linux since the
first day how did it come into existence
let's take a look at some of its history
linux is based on years of knowledge and
experience in building penetration
testing and operating systems
during all these project lifelines there
have been only a few different
developers as the team has always been
small
the first project was called vopex which
stands for white hat nopex
as can be inferred from the name it was
based on the nopix operating system as
its underlying os
topics had releases ranging from version
2.0 to 2.7
this made way for the next project which
was known as wax or the long hand being
white hat slacks the name change was
because the base os was changed from not
picks to slacks
wax started at version 3 as a nord it
carrying on from opex
there was a similar os being produced at
the same time auditor security
collection often being shorted to just
auditor which was once again using nopex
its efforts were combined with wax to
produce backtrack
backtrack was based on slackware from
version 1 to version 3 but switched to
ubuntu later on with version 4 to
version 5.
using the experience gain from all of
this kali linux came after backtrack in
2013.
kali started off using debian stable as
the engine under the hood before moving
to debian testing when kali linux became
a rolling operating system
now that we understand the history and
the purpose of kali linux let us learn a
little more about its distinct features
the latest version of kali comes with
more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed
after reviewing every tool that was
included in backtrack developers have
eliminated a great number of tools that
either simply did not work or which
duplicated other tools that provided the
same or similar functionality
the kali linux team is made up of a
small group of individuals who are the
only ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the depositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols
restricting access of critical code
bases to external asset greatly reduces
the risk of source contamination which
can cause kali linux users worldwide a
great deal of damage as a direct victim
of cyber crime
although penetration tools tend to be
written in english the developers have
ensured that kali includes true
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need for the job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a strong
hold over the configuration and the
device in general
since arm-based single board systems
like the raspberry pi are becoming more
and more prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's arm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations
kali linux is available on a wide range
of arm devices and has arm repositories
integrated with the mainline
distributions so the tools for arm are
updated in conjunction with the rest of
the distribution
all this information is necessary for
users to determine if kali linux is the
correct choice for them
if it is what are the ways that they can
go forward with this installation and
start their penetration testing journey
the first way to use kali linux is by
launching the distribution in the live
usb mode this can be achieved by
downloading the installer image file or
the iso file from the kali linux website
and flashing it to a usb drive with a
capacity of at least 8 gb
some people don't need to save their
data permanently and a live usb is the
perfect solution for such cases
after the iso image is flashed the thumb
drive can be used to boot a fully
working installation of the operating
system with the caviar that any changes
made to the os in this mode are not
written permanently some cases allow
persistent usage in live usbs but those
require further configuration than
normal situations
but what if the user wants to store data
permanently in the installed os
the best and the most reliable way to
ensure this is the full fledged hard
disk installation
this will ensure the complete usage of
the system's hardware capabilities and
will take into account the updates and
the configurations being made to the os
this method is supposed to overwrite any
pre-existing operating system installed
on the computer be it windows or any
other variant of linux
the next alternative route for
installing kali linux would be to use
virtualization software such as vmware
or virtualbox
the software will be installed as a
separate application on an already
existing os and kali linux can be run as
an operating system in the same computer
as a window
the hardware requirements will be
completely customizable starting with
the allotted ram to the virtual hard
disk capacity
the usage of both a host and guest
operating system like our linux allows
users a safe environment to learn while
not putting their systems at risk
if you want to learn more about how one
can go forward with this method we have
a dedicated video where kali linux is
being installed on vmware while running
on a windows 10 operating system you can
find the link in the description box to
get started with your very own virtual
machine
the final way to install kali linux is
by using a dual boot system to put it in
simple words the kali linux os will not
be overwriting any pre-installed
operating system on a machine but will
be installed alongside it when a
computer boots up the user will get a
choice to boot into either of these
operating systems
many people prefer to keep both the
windows and kali linux installed so the
distribution of work and recreational
activities is also allotted effectively
it gives users a safety valve should
their custom linux installation run into
any bugs that cannot be fixed from
within the operating system
