resources all right guys so let's start
with the first topic all right so let's
understand what is digital marketing so
digital marketing is the art of using
the internet to promote products or
services to people who might be
interested in them instead of reling Sol
only on traditional methods like
newspaper ads or Flyers digital
marketing takes advantage of online
platforms like website social media
emails and search engines did you know
that a whooping 89% of Americans go
online every day and about 31% are
online nearly all the time this means
it's super important to be online too by
having ads and stuff online you can make
your brand known give customers a great
experience and even get more people
interested in what you offer by using
digital channels like social media
paperclick ads search engine
optimization and email marketing to
connect with existing customers and then
you can measure your success in numbers
tracking websites visits and social
media engagement email open rates and
more are also used in this this data
helps you understand what's working and
what's not allowing you to adjust your
strategy to maximize the results all
right so this was about digital
marketing now let's understand how is
digital marketing different from
traditional marketing so digital
marketing and traditional marketing are
like two sites of a coin they both aim
to promote products or services but they
do it in different ways here's how it
works first traditional marketing
traditional marketing is like shouting
across the crowded playground to get
everyone's attention so in traditional
marketing let's say tv ads and
billboards think commercial and giant
posters trying to reach a lot of people
at once second example would be
newspapers and flyers spreading messages
through printed materials delivered to
homes or handed out to streets and now
let's talk about the digital marketing
aspect so digital marketing however is
like Whispering directly in the ear of a
person who wants a particular product so
let's say online ads placing ads on
websites or search engines that people
who are already interested in your steps
will see next is social media connecting
with people on platforms like Facebook
and Instagram where you can show them
why your product is is the best then
another example would be targeted emails
sending messages directly to people who
might be interested like offering a
discount on their first product purchase
is another benefit of digital marketing
so basically digital marketing is kind
of more specific and targeted marketing
all right now let's understand how it
actually works so how digital marketing
Works digital marketing works by
leveraging the power of the internet and
Technology to connect with the IAL
customers this involves using online
tools to reach and engage with their
audience where they spend most of their
time that is the internet so let's have
a look at some first on the list is SE
so this helps your website show up in
higher search engine results making it
more likely for people to find you when
they search for something you offer for
example when someone in your area
searches for a freshly baked pastries
SEO ensures that your bakery's website
app appears at the top of the search
results this increases the chance of
local customer finding your bakery
online when they're looking for baked
goods all right so this was about the
SEO now coming to the next one which is
content marketing so this involves
creating useful and interesting content
like blogs videos and social media post
can attract and retain customers for
example you could create engaging
content such as blog post about the
history of pastries tutorial videos on
cake decoration or photos of your latest
Creations on social media this content
not only showcases your expertise but
also keeps your audience engaged and
interested in what you offer next on the
list is social media marketing so this
social media marketing involves using
platforms like Facebook Instagram and
Twitter to connect with your audience
and share content that encourages them
to interact with your brand for example
you can use delicious images of your
Baker Goods interact with customers by
responding to comments and messages and
even run contest or promotions to
attract more people to your store that
is the bakery all right coming to the
next one which is email marketing so
email marketing is like having a
personal connection with your customers
it involves using email to connect with
potential and existing customers it's
essentially sending commercial messages
but with a permission based approach
people who sign up for your email list
are essentially giving you the green
light to send them information for
example you can collect email address
from your customers who visits the
bakery and you can send them regular
updates about new pasty flavors special
promotions or upcoming events at your
bakery this personalized communication
keeps your brand top of mind and
encourages to repeat the business next
is payer click that is PPC advertising
so payper click or PPC advertising is an
online advertising model where
advertisers pay a fee each time their ad
is clicked so it's a way of buying
visits to your website rather than
attempting to earn those visits
organically PPC ads typically appear
alongside search engine results or on
social media platforms and advertisers
bid on keyword to display their ads to
the relevant audiences so example for
this you could create ads that appear
when people search for terms like best
bakery in your town or Target social
media users based on their interest in
baking or deserts with PPC you only pay
when someone clicks on your ad making it
cost effective way to attract potential
customers to your Baker's website or
social media profiles now that we have
